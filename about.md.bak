  <h1>About Faith Frontier</h1>
  <p class="lead">
    Faith Frontier is an ecclesiastical record and commentary project stewarded by
    <strong>Devon Tyler Barber</strong>, a tradesman and pro se litigant who believes that law,
    conscience, and covenant are meant to walk together.

  <h2>Mission</h2>
  <p>
    Faith Frontier exists to document <strong>case records, filings, and covenant-based legal commentary</strong>
    with care and integrity. The goal is simple but demanding: to bear true witness in matters of
    law and public record, and to help ordinary people see how their rights, obligations, and
    spiritual convictions intersect.
  </p>
  <p>
    This work is not a replacement for professional legal representation. It is a <em>witness and archive</em>:
    a place where pleadings, decisions, and arguments can be read in full context, alongside
    reflections grounded in faith and plain-language explanation.

  <h2>About Devon Tyler Barber</h2>
  <p>
    I’m <strong>Devon Tyler Barber</strong>—a builder at heart who values faith, honesty, and hard work.
    I trust that good things take time, and that real love and real justice are chosen through
    patience, truth, and spiritual covenant.
  </p>
  <p>
    My background is in the trades: tiling, building, and remodeling. Alongside that, I serve as a
    <strong>pro se litigant</strong> in New Jersey courts, pressing into questions of due process,
    constitutional limits, and administrative overreach. Faith Frontier is where those worlds meet:
    the practical, the legal, and the spiritual.

  <h2>Not Legal Advice</h2>
  <p>
    Nothing on Faith Frontier is legal advice. Reading a case record, essay, or template does not
    create an attorney–client relationship. Laws and court rules change, and every situation is
    different. If you are facing a legal problem, you should consider consulting a licensed attorney
    in your jurisdiction.
