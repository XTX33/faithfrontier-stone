        This is the story of how a dual-household childhood became a commitment to faithful stewardship
        under the law. It traces the path from unanswered questions to transparent recordkeeping so that
        neighbors, officials, and congregations can verify what Faith Frontier claims.

    <h2>Chapter One: Two Houses</h2>
    <p>
      Devon Tyler was born into a structured childhood. There was order, responsibility, and expectation;
      there was also distance. Two households, two sets of routines, two kinds of authority. The experience
      did not produce resentment toward institutions. Instead, it nurtured attentiveness: How do rules work?
      What deserves loyalty? Who ensures that facts are kept straight?
    </p>
    <p>
      That attentiveness set a lifelong pattern — observe carefully, verify patiently, and treat oversight as
      a safeguard rather than a threat.
    </p>

    <h2 style="margin-top: 3rem;">Chapter Two: Rituals Without Meaning</h2>
    <p>
      Traditions framed his youth — Sunday worship, holidays, confirmation class. He participated willingly
      but asked what each practice meant. The questions were sincere, not rebellious, and they planted a
      conviction that meaning must be articulated, cited, and accountable to Scripture rather than treated as
      assumed folklore.
    </p>

    <h2 style="margin-top: 3rem;">Chapter Three: The Pandemic Era</h2>
    <p>
      The pandemic era magnified the need for clarity. Institutions faced unprecedented strain; people were
      fearful; misinformation circulated. Devon asked process questions and sought source documents, aiming to
      honor lawful authority while ensuring that conscience remained intact. The experience reinforced that
      fidelity to both faith and public order requires patient documentation, not suspicion.
    </p>

    <h2 style="margin-top: 3rem;">Chapter Four: Exile and Awakening</h2>
    <p>
      Isolation clarified callings. Scripture and civic history provided anchors: Christ directs conscience,
      the Constitution provides the legal framework, and transparency allows neighbors to test both claims and
      motives. The mission became plain — pair repentance with documentation so that questions are answered with
      citations instead of speculation.
    </p>

    <h2 style="margin-top: 3rem;">Chapter Five: The Declaration</h2>
    <p>
      Faith Frontier was born from that clarity. It is a commitment to document cases, timelines, filings,
      and partnerships so others can verify the work. It is a promise to keep faith reflections distinct from
      legal claims and to welcome correction from courts, agencies, journalists, and neighbors.
    </p>

    <p>
      It honors the past with gratitude. It names the present with evidence. It builds a future grounded in
      lawful stewardship, local accountability, and faith-informed conscience.
    </p>

    <h2 style="margin-top: 3rem;">Chapter Six: The Mission</h2>
    <p>
      Today, Faith Frontier serves New Jersey residents with practical tools, transparent documentation,
      and faith-rooted advocacy that respects due process. It is a witness to how trust can be rebuilt when
      claims are sourced, filings are shared, and hospitality replaces outrage. Each docket entry published
      and each partnership formed is an answer to the childhood questions: <em>Why? What does this mean? Is
      there something deeper?</em>
    </p>
    <p>
      The answer is <strong>yes</strong> — and it can be inspected by anyone.

        <li style="padding: 0.75rem 0; border-bottom: 1px solid var(--brass-alpha-20);">
          <strong>Evidence Before Assertion:</strong> Publish the record, cite the source, and separate faith commentary from
          legal claims.
        </li>
        <li style="padding: 0.75rem 0; border-bottom: 1px solid var(--brass-alpha-20);">
          <strong>Conscience Within Law:</strong> Faith directs personal conduct; courts, statutes, and public agencies set the
          civic framework. We respect both and invite oversight.
        </li>
        <li style="padding: 0.75rem 0; border-bottom: 1px solid var(--brass-alpha-20);">
          <strong>Transparency Over Suspicion:</strong> When something is alleged, show the document; when something is unclear,
          say so plainly and seek clarification.
        </li>
        <li style="padding: 0.75rem 0; border-bottom: 1px solid var(--brass-alpha-20);">
          <strong>Local Stewardship:</strong> Rebuild community at human scale with lawful contracts, zoning compliance, and worker
          protections.
        </li>
        <li style="padding: 0.75rem 0; border-bottom: 1px solid var(--brass-alpha-20);">
          <strong>Humility & Correction:</strong> Admit limits, publish errata, and welcome review from public agencies, neighbors,
          and the press.
        </li>
        <li style="padding: 0.75rem 0;">
          <strong>Service Over Spectacle:</strong> Focus on housing stability, lawful work, recovery pathways, and civic education
          rather than performative outrage.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <h2 style="margin-top: 3rem;">What This Means for New Jersey</h2>
    <p>
      Faith Frontier translates this personal journey into practical service. We document cases that 
      expose procedural gaps. We equip residents with plain-language guidance. We stand beside families 
      as they navigate courts, agencies, and systems that often fail to see them as human.
    </p>
    <p>
      We do this because we know what it feels like to be caught between two worlds, two systems, two 
      ways of seeing reality. And we believe that clarity, truth, and faith can bridge those gaps.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is more than advocacy. It's discipleship. It's stewardship. It's the work of rebuilding trust 
      one case, one conversation, one act of mercy at a time.
