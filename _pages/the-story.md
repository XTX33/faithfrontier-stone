        This is the story of a man raised between two houses in a world breaking between two eras. 
        It is a story of confusion and clarity, exile and awakening, questions and faith. It is the 
        story of how Faith Frontier came to be.
      </p>
    </div>

    <h2>Chapter One: Two Houses</h2>
    <p>
      Devon Tyler was born into a structured childhood. There was order, responsibility, expectation. 
      But from the beginning, there was also duality.
    </p>
    <p>
      He grew up between two houses. One was familiar—the home where he lived, where routines unfolded, 
      where structure provided stability. The other was distant, rarely visited. His biological father 
      appeared occasionally, creating not trauma but something subtler: confusion. Not abandonment, but 
      absence. Not rejection, but distance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two fathers. Two identities. Two ways of seeing the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      This wasn't a broken home in the conventional sense. It was a <em>dual</em> home—one that taught 
      Devon to navigate structure while sensing something beneath the surface. He learned to read rooms, 
      to adapt, to question quietly.
    </p>

    <h2 style="margin-top: 3rem;">Chapter Two: Rituals Without Meaning</h2>
    <p>
      Growing up, Devon participated in the expected traditions. Christmas. Easter. Sunday school. 
      Confirmation. The structure was there, the rituals were followed, but something was missing.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Why do we do this?</em> he would wonder. <em>What does it mean?</em>
    </p>
    <p>
      The answers he received felt hollow—traditions observed but not understood, holidays celebrated 
      but not rooted in anything deeper. It wasn't rebellion that drove his questions. It was sincerity. 
      He wanted to know <em>why</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
      This searching would lie dormant for years, buried under the demands of school, work, and the 
      expectations of a structured life. But it never disappeared. It waited.
    </p>

    <h2 style="margin-top: 3rem;">Chapter Three: The Pandemic Era</h2>
    <p>
      Then came 2020. The world changed overnight.
    </p>
    <p>
      What began as a public health crisis became something more: a test of institutions, a fracturing 
      of communities, a demand for conformity unlike anything his generation had seen. Fear ruled. 
      Dissent was treated as danger. Questions were silenced.
    </p>
    <p>
      Devon found himself on the outside—not because he sought conflict, but because he refused to 
      surrender his conscience. He asked questions. He sought clarity. He insisted on truth.
    </p>
    <p>
      For that, he was misunderstood. Then accused. Then exiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      Families fractured. Communities divided. Institutions that once provided stability now demanded 
      blind obedience. The dual household of his childhood became a mirror of the world itself: two 
      systems, two narratives, two realities—and no clear path between them.
    </p>

    <h2 style="margin-top: 3rem;">Chapter Four: Exile and Awakening</h2>
    <p>
      Isolation is a strange teacher.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the silence that followed, Devon had no choice but to face himself. His identity. His beliefs. 
      His place in a world that seemed to be collapsing around him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He turned to Scripture—not out of desperation, but out of hunger. He read history, examined systems, 
      asked the great questions of meaning and sovereignty. He studied the centralization of power, the 
      erosion of local community, the weakening of family bonds.
    </p>
    <p>
      And he realized: <strong>the world was not just changing. It was breaking between two eras.</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      One era built on global systems, distant institutions, and bureaucratic control. Another era—one 
      still emerging—that demanded local sovereignty, personal identity, and spiritual clarity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Devon found himself in the space between. The same space he'd occupied his entire life.
    </p>

    <h2 style="margin-top: 3rem;">Chapter Five: The Declaration</h2>
    <p>
      Faith Frontier was born in that moment—not as a project, but as a necessity.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is Devon's answer to a world that demands conformity but offers no meaning. It is his declaration 
      of identity in an age of institutional pressure. It is his commitment to rebuild meaning, community, 
      and faith at human scale.
    </p>

        Faith Frontier is the work of being <em>in the world, but not of it</em>.
      </p>
    </div>

    <p>
      It honors the past without blaming it. It names the present without fearing it. It builds a future 
      grounded in clarity, sovereignty, and local faith.
    </p>

    <h2 style="margin-top: 3rem;">Chapter Six: The Mission</h2>
    <p>
      Today, Faith Frontier serves New Jersey residents with practical tools, transparent documentation, 
      and faith-rooted advocacy. But it is more than that.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is a witness. A testimony to the possibility of rebuilding trust, meaning, and community in an 
      age of institutional failure. It is proof that one person, standing in the space between two eras, 
      can build something that honors both truth and mercy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every case documented, every resident served, every act of stewardship is an answer to the questions 
      Devon asked as a child: <em>Why? What does this mean? Is there something deeper?</em>
    </p>
    <p>
      The answer is <strong>yes</strong>.
    </p>

    <h2 style="margin-top: 3rem;">What This Means for New Jersey</h2>
    <p>
      Faith Frontier translates this personal journey into practical service. We document cases that 
      expose procedural gaps. We equip residents with plain-language guidance. We stand beside families 
      as they navigate courts, agencies, and systems that often fail to see them as human.
    </p>
    <p>
      We do this because we know what it feels like to be caught between two worlds, two systems, two 
      ways of seeing reality. And we believe that clarity, truth, and faith can bridge those gaps.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is more than advocacy. It's discipleship. It's stewardship. It's the work of rebuilding trust 
      one case, one conversation, one act of mercy at a time.
