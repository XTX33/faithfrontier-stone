Faith Frontier Ecclesiastical Trust is a religious-purpose trust committed to sanctuary, agrarian, charitable, and justice-oriented work for New Jersey residents. Its mission is rooted in Christ’s teaching that the hungry, the stranger, and the prisoner are to be welcomed and fed (Matthew 25:35–40). The trust exists to steward places like **Tillerstead Sanctuary** so that people find refuge, meaningful work, and community without exploitation.

## Biblical anchors for the mission

- **Proclaiming freedom and healing:** Jesus announced good news to the poor and release for the oppressed (Luke 4:18–19). This shapes the sanctuary’s outreach to people in addiction and crisis.
- **Repairing what is broken:** Isaiah 58 calls God’s people “repairers of the breach” and rebuilders of ruined places. Tillerstead Sanctuary is a literal rebuilding of a wounded property for mercy and work.
- **Restoring cities:** Amos 9:14 speaks of ruined cities being restored. The former Atlantic Club, a symbol of the casino era, becomes a working house of refuge and agriculture.
- **Bearing lasting fruit:** John 15 invites disciples to bear fruit that endures. Hydroponics, microgreens, and agrarian training make this tangible, while hospitality and craftsmanship create spiritual “fruit” of service.
- **New creation hope:** Revelation 21–22 describes a city with healing leaves and the tree of life. Sanctuary floors, prayer spaces, and gardens echo that promise.

## How the scriptures shape the work

- **Sanctuary floors and prayer:** Quiet rooms, chapels, and community halls reflect a call to shelter and pray for New Jersey’s people.
- **Legal and civic empowerment:** Justice clinics and civic navigation help neighbors stand up in lawful ways, serving the oppressed without coercion.
- **Trade training and craftsmanship:** Workshops for carpentry, tile, maintenance, and hospitality honor work as stewardship and dignity.
- **Agriculture and microgreens:** Indoor agriculture is a living parable of “land of milk and honey” abundance, feeding the community and training new growers.
- **Recovery and healing:** Detox partnerships, counseling, and structured daily rhythms embody Christ’s healing ministry and Isaiah’s promise to bind up the broken.
