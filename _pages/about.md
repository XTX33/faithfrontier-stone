  <h1>The Man Behind Faith Frontier</h1>
  <p class="lead">
    This is the story of Devon Tyler — a man raised between two houses in a world breaking
    between two eras. It is a story of seeking clarity in confusion, identity in pressure,
    and meaning in a time when institutions are collapsing and local communities are being forgotten.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="section-content" style="max-width: 60rem; margin: 0 auto 3rem;">
  
  <h2>Two Houses</h2>
  <p>
    Devon grew up between two worlds. He lived in a stable, structured home with his mother
    and stepfather — a place of order, responsibility, and clear expectations. But once or
    twice a year, he would visit his biological father, a man who remained distant but not
    harmful, unfamiliar but not threatening.
  </p>
  <p>
    This duality shaped him early. It wasn't trauma, but it was confusion — a sense of being
    rooted in one place while connected to another he barely knew. Structure in one house,
    unfamiliarity in the other. Two fathers, two identities, two ways of seeing the world.
  </p>

  <h2>The Father Who Raised Me</h2>
  <p>
    Devon's stepfather instilled discipline, structure, and expectation. He taught the value
    of work, the importance of showing up, and the necessity of following through. It wasn't
    malice — it was preparation. Devon learned early that the world requires order, and that
    responsibility is not optional.
  </p>
  <p>
    But beneath the structure, Devon sensed something else: rituals without meaning, traditions
    without depth, holidays observed but not understood. He began to ask questions — not out
    of rebellion, but out of sincerity. <em>Why do we do this? What does it mean? Is there
    something deeper?</em>
  </p>

  <h2>Growing Inside the Lines</h2>
  <p>
    Devon was a child who colored inside the lines. He followed rules, met expectations, and
    kept his questions mostly to himself. But the questions never left. He searched beneath
    the surface of traditions and rituals, looking for the meaning that felt just out of reach.
  </p>
  <p>
    His spiritual questioning was not rebellion — it was curiosity. It was a desire to understand
    the world not just as it appeared, but as it <em>was</em>. And that search would define him.
  </p>

  <h2>When the World Shifted</h2>
  <p>
    Then came the pandemic era — a time of fear, polarization, and institutional pressure unlike
    anything Devon's generation had seen. Families fractured over ideological lines. Communities
    divided. The institutions people once trusted began to demand conformity, and dissent was
    treated as danger.
  </p>
  <p>
    Devon found himself on the outside — not because he sought it, but because he refused to
    surrender his conscience. Misunderstandings became accusations. Questions became threats.
    What began as ideological clash became exile.
  </p>
  <p>
    And in that exile, something awakened.
  </p>

  <h2>Isolation and Awakening</h2>
  <p>
    Isolation is a strange teacher. It strips away noise, distraction, and the comfort of
    belonging. In the silence, Devon had no choice but to face himself — his identity, his
    beliefs, his place in a world that seemed to be collapsing around him.
  </p>
  <p>
    He turned to Scripture, to history, to the great questions of meaning and sovereignty.
    He examined the systems that had shaped his life — the centralization of power, the
    erosion of local community, the weakening of family bonds, the consolidation of control
    in distant, impersonal institutions.
  </p>
  <p>
    And he realized: the world was not just changing. It was breaking between two eras.
  </p>

  <h2>The Birth of Faith Frontier</h2>
  <p>
    Faith Frontier was born in that moment — not as a project, but as a necessity. It is
    Devon's answer to a world that demands conformity but offers no meaning. It is his
    declaration of identity in an age of institutional pressure. It is his commitment to
    rebuild meaning, community, and faith at human scale.
  </p>
  <p>
    It is not a rejection of the world, but a reclamation of what matters within it:
    <strong>truth, search, identity, belonging, sovereignty, and local connection</strong>.
  </p>
  <p style="font-weight: 600; color: var(--accent-emerald); margin-top: 2rem;">
    Faith Frontier is the work of being <em>in the world, but not of it</em>.
  </p>

  <h2 style="margin-top: 0; color: var(--color-highlight);">The Era We're Living In</h2>
  <p>
    Devon's story is not just personal — it's a reflection of the times. We live in an era of:
  </p>
  <ul style="line-height: 1.8;">
    <li><strong>Accelerating centralization</strong> — digital, political, economic, bureaucratic, and ideological.</li>
    <li><strong>Weakening local communities</strong> — the erosion of family bonds, neighborhood ties, and grounded institutions.</li>
    <li><strong>Institutional pressure</strong> — systems that demand conformity, punish dissent, and erase personal truth.</li>
    <li><strong>Global overreach</strong> — power consolidating in distant, unaccountable systems while local voices are silenced.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Faith Frontier stands as a response: a declaration that personal sovereignty, local connection,
    and grounded truth must be protected. That meaning cannot be dictated from above. That identity
    cannot be erased by systems.

  <h2>The Journey Continues</h2>
  <p>
    Devon's story is not finished. It is still being written — in essays, in reflections,
    in lived experience, and in the ongoing work of rebuilding meaning in a fractured world.
  </p>
  <p>
    Faith Frontier is not a destination. It is a frontier — a boundary, a threshold, a place
    where wilderness meets settlement, where exile becomes return, where the man Devon was
    becomes the man he is meant to be.
  </p>
  <p style="font-size: 1.1rem; font-weight: 500; margin-top: 2rem;">
    This is the work of being <em>in the world, but not of it</em>. And it is work that continues,
    one day, one word, one step at a time.
