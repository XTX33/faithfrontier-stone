  <h1>About Faith Frontier Ecclesiastical Trust</h1>
  <p class="lead">
    Faith Frontier is a Christian, non-denominational witness to Jesus Christ, rooted in Biblical principles and devoted to New
    Jersey’s people. We are building an ecclesiastical public-trust framework that advances ethical treatment, public
    accountability, and restored dignity in legal and civic processes.
  </p>
  <p class="lead" style="max-width: 54rem;">
    Our work emerges from lived encounters with injustice, but it looks forward: turning lessons into stewardship, clarity, and
    hope for residents engaging courts, agencies, police, landlords, contractors, and other public-trust actors. Learn more in
    our <a href="{{ '/about/faith-frontier-identity/' | relative_url }}">Identity &amp; Beliefs</a> page.

  <h2>Why We Formed</h2>
  <p>
    Devon Tyler’s path exposed how ordinary people can feel unseen in procedural systems. Those experiences revealed gaps in due
    process, communication, and care. Rather than stay in that past, Faith Frontier turns the testimony into forward action:
    building tools, relationships, and standards that honor truth while repairing trust.
  </p>

  <h2>Mission & Vision for New Jersey</h2>
  <ul style="line-height: 1.8;">
    <li>Create a faith-rooted public trust that models integrity, transparency, and mercy in civic life.</li>
    <li>Equip New Jersey residents with plain-language guides so they can navigate courts, agencies, housing matters, and work with confidence.</li>
    <li>Collaborate with churches, advocates, professionals, and officials to strengthen due process and equitable treatment.</li>
    <li>Advance sanctuary and restoration projects that connect neighbors to housing, work, and healing pathways.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    This site is for you if you need clarity on how to navigate filings, hearings, public benefits, housing issues, or work
    disruptions in New Jersey. Use these resources to prepare, pray, and plan — then bring them to licensed counsel, trusted
    advocates, or community leaders who can walk with you.
  </p>
  <p style="font-size: 1.05rem; line-height: 1.7;">
    You can expect honest documentation, faith-rooted encouragement, and practical guidance that respects both your conscience
    and the rule of law. We believe courts and agencies can serve the people when neighbors show up with truth and humility.
