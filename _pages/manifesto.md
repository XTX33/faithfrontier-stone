        Faith Frontier is the story of a man raised between two houses in a world breaking
        between two eras. It is a home for those who feel the weight of global systems yet
        refuse to lose their humanity. It is a declaration of identity over bureaucracy,
        spirit over systems, meaning over machinery.

    <h2>The Story</h2>
    <p>
      Devon Tyler was born into a structured childhood — raised with order, responsibility,
      and expectation. But he grew up between two houses: one familiar, one distant. His
      biological father visited rarely, creating not trauma but confusion. Two fathers,
      two identities, two ways of seeing the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      This duality shaped him. He learned to navigate structure while sensing something
      beneath the surface — rituals without meaning, traditions without depth, holidays
      observed but not understood. He began to ask questions, not out of rebellion but
      out of sincerity: <em>Why? What does this mean? Is there something deeper?</em>
    </p>
    <p>
      Then came the pandemic era — a time of fear, polarization, and institutional pressure
      unlike anything his generation had seen. Families fractured. Communities divided.
      Institutions demanded conformity and treated dissent as danger.
    </p>
    <p>
      Devon found himself on the outside — not because he sought it, but because he refused
      to surrender his conscience. Misunderstandings became accusations. Questions became
      threats. What began as ideological clash became exile.
    </p>
    <p>
      And in that exile, something awakened.
    </p>

    <h2 style="margin-top: 3rem;">The Awakening</h2>
    <p>
      Isolation is a strange teacher. In the silence, Devon had no choice but to face
      himself — his identity, his beliefs, his place in a world that seemed to be
      collapsing around him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He turned to Scripture, to history, to the great questions of meaning and sovereignty.
      He examined the systems that had shaped his life: the centralization of power, the
      erosion of local community, the weakening of family bonds, the consolidation of
      control in distant, impersonal institutions.
    </p>
    <p>
      And he realized: the world was not just changing. It was breaking between two eras.
    </p>

    <h2 style="margin-top: 3rem;">The Declaration</h2>
    <p>
      Faith Frontier was born in that moment — not as a project, but as a necessity.
      It is Devon's answer to a world that demands conformity but offers no meaning.
      It is his declaration of identity in an age of institutional pressure. It is
      his commitment to rebuild meaning, community, and faith at human scale.

        <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">
          Personal truth and lived experience matter more than institutional narratives.

        <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">
          Human identity cannot be reduced to data, categories, or institutional labels.
          We are more than numbers in a database.

          modern systems. We are spirit, not machine.

    <h2 style="margin-top: 3rem;">The Commitment</h2>
    <p>
      Faith Frontier commits to:
    </p>
    <ul style="line-height: 1.9;">
      <li><strong>Truthfulness</strong> — No deliberate misrepresentation of fact, record, or lived experience.</li>
      <li><strong>Sincerity</strong> — Spiritual searching that is honest, not performative; grounded, not dogmatic.</li>
      <li><strong>Clarity</strong> — Clear-eyed awareness of the times without fearmongering or alarmism.</li>
      <li><strong>Humility</strong> — Recognition that this work is imperfect, ongoing, and open to correction.</li>
      <li><strong>Courage</strong> — The willingness to name what is true even when it is difficult.</li>
      <li><strong>Community</strong> — A commitment to rebuild meaning and belonging at human scale.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 style="margin-top: 3rem;">The Invitation</h2>
    <p>
      This manifesto is not just for Devon Tyler. It is for everyone who feels the weight
      of global systems yet refuses to lose their humanity. For those rebuilding meaning
      and identity at human scale in an era of global reach. For those searching for clarity
      in a time of confusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      For those who are <em>in the world, but not of it</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you feel the same, this frontier is yours too.

    <h2 style="margin-top: 0;">Walk This Frontier</h2>
    <p style="font-size: 1.1rem; line-height: 1.8; max-width: 40rem; margin: 0 auto 2rem;">
      Faith Frontier is not a destination. It is a journey, a threshold, a place where
      wilderness meets settlement, where exile becomes return, where the man Devon was
      becomes the man he is meant to be.
