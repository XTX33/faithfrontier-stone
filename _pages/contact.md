  <h1>Contact</h1>
  <p class="lead">
    Faith Frontier is a small, intentional work committed to verifiable transparency.
    If you want to collaborate, correct the public record, or explore how faith and law
    meet in responsible stewardship — reach out.
  </p>

  <h2>Email</h2>
  <p>
    For inquiries, dialogue, or collaboration, write to:
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="mailto:tylerstead@protonmail.com" style="color: var(--accent-emerald); font-weight: 600;">tylerstead@protonmail.com</a>
  </p>
  <p>
    Please include a clear subject line that reflects your purpose — whether it's about
    Devon's story, an essay, a case record, or something else entirely. If you are
    providing documents or corrections, cite docket numbers or source links so they can
    be verified.

  <h2>What This Is Not</h2>
  <p>
    Faith Frontier is not a law firm and Devon is not an attorney. Please <strong>do not</strong> use this contact page to:
  </p>
  <ul style="line-height: 1.8;">
    <li>Request personalized legal advice on your specific situation.</li>
    <li>Send confidential or highly sensitive information you wouldn't want disclosed.</li>
    <li>Attempt to serve formal legal papers or documents.</li>
    <li>Seek insider shortcuts or extrajudicial outcomes that bypass courts, statutes, or due process.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    If you are facing an active legal crisis — criminal charges, eviction, domestic matters, or
    other urgent situations — please contact a licensed attorney or legal-aid organization in
    your jurisdiction. Time matters in law, and missed deadlines can be impossible to undo.

  <h2 style="margin-top: 0;">Prayer & Encouragement</h2>
  <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">
    If you are walking through trials — legal, spiritual, or otherwise — and need someone to
    stand in prayer with you for wisdom, courage, and clarity, you are welcome to say so.
    Faith Frontier is grounded in the belief that we are not alone in our struggles, and that
    grounded faith matters more than ever in times of pressure. Prayer is offered alongside,
    not instead of, lawful counsel and professional help.

  <h2>Response Time</h2>
  <p>
    This is intentional work, not mass communication. Responses may take time, but every
    sincere message is read. If your inquiry aligns with the mission and tone of Faith Frontier,
    you'll hear back. Requests that include verifiable facts or docket references are easiest to
    prioritize.
