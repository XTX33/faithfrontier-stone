I, Devon Tyler, covenant before God and my neighbors to steward Faith Frontier and Tillerstead Sanctuary for the public good, in ways that welcome lawful oversight and transparent recordkeeping.

- I will labor to **rebuild the ruins**, following Isaiah 58 and Amos 9:14, so that abandoned places become houses of mercy and work.
- I will **avoid exploitation**, rejecting gambling, predatory finance, and any practice that harms New Jersey residents.
- I will **serve New Jersey’s people**, prioritizing local workers, families, and neighbors in every hiring, housing, and training decision.
- I will **keep the sanctuary dedicated to God** — a place of prayer, hospitality, craftsmanship, and agriculture that points to Revelation’s healing city and John 15 fruit.
- I will **honor justice, mercy, and humility**, remembering Matthew 25 compassion and walking with integrity before civic authorities and communities.
- I will **document decisions and filings**, keeping public records accurate and inviting correction so that the trust’s work stays accountable to courts, regulators, and partners.

May this covenant guide every negotiation, partnership, and decision as Tillerstead Sanctuary rises on the Atlantic shore.
