  <h2>Purpose</h2>
  <p>
    The Ecclesiastical Deed Poll (EDP) was written as a spiritual covenant —
    a testament to divine sovereignty and the inherent dignity of humankind.
    It stands as a record of faith, not a legal instrument.
  </p>

  <h2>Key Principles</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Divine Authority:</strong> All power originates from the Creator; no human system can rightfully enslave the soul.</li>
    <li><strong>Conscience & Stewardship:</strong> Law without mercy is tyranny; conscience without law is chaos.</li>
    <li><strong>Faith in Justice:</strong> Every living soul is heir to truth, mercy, and redemption.</li>
  </ul>
