      <p><em>Repost from Food Revolution Network – “11 Banned Foods Americans Should Stop Eating.”</em></p>
    </header>

    <p>
      Each country has its own standards for what ingredients and food production practices it considers safe.
      And some of what’s considered normal practice for the food industry in the United States is handled very
      differently in other countries.
    </p>

    <p>
      It’s well known that rates of chronic diseases like cancer, heart disease, diabetes, and obesity are high
      in the U.S. And the country is also saturated with food allergies and behavioral disorders. In many cases,
      these conditions and diseases are highly preventable. It turns out that there are a number of ingredients
      and food additives that other countries have banned, but the U.S. still uses. Could it be possible that
      some of them could be playing a part in the public health crises?
    </p>

    <h2>The Problem with FDA Regulation</h2>

    <p>
      As much as we would like to believe that everything on store shelves is delicious, good for us, and safe,
      the truth is not always so reassuring. In fact, the food supply in the U.S. (and many other nations, too)
      is full of chemical flavorings, additives, colorings, and other ingredients that you may not want to put in
      your body. Before we start naming names, let’s explore how the U.S. government could let this happen.
    </p>

    <p>
      For starters, the FDA states that food companies can market new chemicals and food additives without FDA
      oversight or approval, so long as “the substance is generally recognized, among qualified experts, as having
      been adequately shown to be safe.”
    </p>

    <p>
      This is known as the GRAS system, and it might sound all well and good. But what makes someone a “qualified
      expert”? And how are they able to determine which chemicals food companies can add to the food we feed our
      children? It turns out that these companies often convene their own “expert” panels to decide whether the
      ingredient will pose harm. And many of these panels contain scientists with financial ties to all manner of
      industries – even including the tobacco industry (“experts” who may have, at one time, recommended that
      cigarettes were safe!). Based on the panel’s recommendations, companies then decide whether or not to share
      the results of the assessment with the FDA. They don’t even have to do so!
    </p>

    <h2>11 Banned Ingredients That Are STILL Widely Used in the U.S.</h2>

    <p>
      Below are some of the most commonly used food ingredients and practices that are allowed in the United States,
      but banned elsewhere.
    </p>

    <h3><em>Banned Ingredients #1 — Dough Conditioners</em></h3>
    <p>
      Dough conditioners, such as potassium bromate and azodicarbonamide, are chemicals used to improve the strength
      and texture of bread dough. They are often found in white breads, rolls, and “egg breads.” However, they are
      possible human carcinogens (potassium bromate is classified as a category 2B carcinogen). And exposure to them
      is known to cause respiratory sensitivity, such as asthma or other breathing difficulty. As such, potassium
      bromate is banned in China, India, Brazil, the European Union, and Canada. And azodicarbonamide is banned in
      Australia and Europe.
    </p>

    <h3><em>Banned Ingredients #2 — Brominated Vegetable Oil (BVO)</em></h3>
    <p>
      Brominated vegetable oil (BVO) was originally patented by chemical companies as a flame retardant. But now, BVO
      can be found in certain colorful sports drinks and citrus-flavored sodas as an emulsifier. Studies have shown
      that BVO isn’t harmless. It actually accumulates in human tissue, as well as breast milk, and can cause memory
      loss over time. Bromine toxicity can lead to skin rashes, appetite loss, and heart problems, as well as major
      organ damage and birth defects. Bromine also competes with iodine for receptor sites in the body, which can
      increase risk for iodine deficiency, autoimmune disease, and even certain cancers. And although BVO has been
      banned in countries like Japan, it’s been used in food and beverages in America since 1977 when it was approved
      by the FDA.
    </p>

    <h3><em>Banned Ingredients #3 — Propylparaben</em></h3>
    <p>
      In the United States, propylparaben is used as a preservative in tortillas, muffins, trail mix, pies, sausage
      rolls, and more. Research has found that it can affect sex hormones and sperm counts in young rats. Cornell
      University research has also indicated that exposure to parabens may be linked to breast cancer. Environmental
      Working Group senior scientist Johanna Congleton, Ph.D., tells us, “It is of great concern to us that the use
      of an endocrine-disrupting chemical in our food is considered safe by our own government… Studies show that
      chemicals that disrupt hormone signaling can lead to developmental and reproductive problems.” Propylparaben is
      totally legal in the U.S., but in 2006 the European Food Safety Authority banned the use of propylparaben in
      food. And in 2015, the EU went further – also banning propylparaben from cosmetic products.
    </p>

    <h3><em>Banned Ingredients #4 — BHA and BHT</em></h3>
    <p>
      BHA and BHT are popular man-made antioxidants used in dry mixes, cereals, and dehydrated potato products to
      preserve them and increase shelf life. They’re also found in product packaging. These are possible carcinogens
      and endocrine disruptors — meaning that they can alter the normal function of your hormones and lead to disease.
      BHA and BHT are banned for use in food and beverages by the United Kingdom, European Union, Japan, and other
      countries.
    </p>

    <h3><em>Banned Ingredients #5 — Synthetic Food Dyes</em></h3>
    <p>
      Food manufacturers use synthetic food dyes, such as blue 2, yellow 5, and red 40, to enhance the coloring
      of certain foods and ingredients to make them more appealing to consumers. Some foods that contain food dyes
      include beverages (like juices, sports drinks, and sodas), candy, and glazes used in baked goods and sweets.
      They’re even used in silly things like making mustard more yellow, salmon more pink, and jarred pickles the
      perfect shade of yellow-green. And don’t even get me started on maraschino cherries!
    </p>
    <p>
      Research has linked consumption of synthetic dyes to an increased risk for numerous conditions, like tumors
      and hyperactivity in children. What’s even more infuriating is that the U.S. used to use natural food dyes
      until the mid-19th century. But then, food manufacturers realized it was much cheaper to use chemicals,
      which turned food even brighter colors.
    </p>
    <p>
      Synthetic food dyes are banned in Europe and Australia, where more natural coloring compounds are used. For
      example, in most of the world, Fanta contains actual fruit juice and is dyed naturally. But Americans enjoy
      Fanta colored with petroleum-derived artificial dyes like red 40 and yellow 6.
    </p>

    <h3><em>Banned Ingredients #6 — GMOs</em></h3>
    <p>
      Genetically modified organisms (GMOs) have been around since the 1980s. But they have become a controversial
      topic — and for good reason. While they’re widespread in the U.S. — with most U.S. soy, sugar beets, corn,
      canola, cotton, and alfalfa being GMO crops — many European countries have banned or regulated them due to
      public safety concerns.
    </p>
    <p>
      One common genetic manipulation involves altering DNA in certain crops to make them resistant to herbicides.
      One of the most common herbicides used in conjunction with these GMOs is glyphosate, the primary active
      ingredient in the weedkiller Roundup. Glyphosate consumption is linked to cancer. In fact, several people
      have won cases that allege glyphosate caused their cancer. Bayer, the manufacturer of Roundup, is currently
      fighting cancer lawsuits that involve over 13,000 people. As of June 2019, there were bans or major restrictions
      on use of glyphosate in many countries worldwide.
    </p>

    <h3><em>Banned Ingredients #7 — Roxarsone</em></h3>
    <p>
      The arsenic-based drug roxarsone was routinely used in chicken in the U.S. until July 2011, when Pfizer decided
      to stop selling it. However, there is no actual ban on the use of arsenic in the raising of chickens for food.
      Roxarsone was used to increase the pink coloring of raw chicken meat, to speed the growth of the birds before
      slaughter, and to prevent parasites in the chicken’s stomach. Research shows chronic exposure to arsenic can
      lead to anemia, skin lesions, kidney damage. It can also increase the risk for certain cancers, miscarriage,
      and birth defects. The European Union banned the use of arsenic-based drugs, while many chicken products in
      the U.S. still contain it.
    </p>

    <h3><em>Banned Ingredients #8 — Ractopamine</em></h3>
    <p>
      In the U.S., ractopamine is a muscle enhancer for pigs, cows, and turkeys. And, like other harmful substances
      used during the raising of animals, it doesn’t just go away when the animal is slaughtered. Some of it is still
      left in the meat you buy. Ractopamine is banned in many countries, including Russia, mainland China, Taiwan,
      and many across Europe. This is because it’s been linked to reproductive and cardiovascular damage in humans,
      as well as chromosomal and behavioral changes.
    </p>

    <h3><em>Banned Ingredients #9 — Herbicides, Insecticides, Fungicides</em></h3>
    <p>
      Herbicides, insecticides, and fungicides are widely used on crops in the U.S. food system to keep them free of
      bugs and diseases. Meanwhile, other countries see (and act on) the danger they pose to humans. Of the 374 active
      ingredients authorized for agricultural use in the U.S. in 2016, the European Union banned 72 of them.
    </p>

    <h3><em>Banned Ingredients #10 — Olestra</em></h3>
    <p>
      Olestra, or Olean, is a cholesterol-free fat substitute created by Procter &amp; Gamble. The FDA approved it
      for use in foods in the 1990s and it’s still used in certain potato chips and french fries. But Olestra may
      cause extremely unpleasant digestive reactions, like diarrhea and leaky bowels. Consuming a lot of it can also
      lead to deficiencies in fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E, K, as well as carotenoids. Both Canada and the United
      Kingdom have banned the ingredient.
    </p>

    <h3><em>Banned Ingredients #11 — Synthetic Hormones</em></h3>
    <p>
      Synthetic hormones, such as rBGH and rBST, are widely used in the U.S. dairy industry. The primary reason for
      this is to increase milk production in dairy cows. However, rBGH increases IGF-1 levels in humans and may
      increase the risk of developing cancer. Additionally, cows treated with rBGH are more likely to develop
      mastitis, an udder infection, requiring treatment with antibiotics. Canada, the EU, and other countries have
      banned these compounds.
    </p>

    <h2><em>What You Can Do</em></h2>

    <p>
      The question you might be asking right now is, what can I do to protect myself from these banned ingredients?
      While we can’t immediately control what food companies put in their products, we don’t have to eat them. And
      there are steps you can take to make healthier, safer food choices, wherever you live.
    </p>

    <h3><em>Here are some things you can do to make sure the food you eat is as safe as possible:</em></h3>

    <ul>
      <li>Read all food labels carefully. Get familiar with these banned ingredients and their alternative names, and look for them on packaged foods.</li>
      <li>Eat minimally processed or, even better, whole, organic foods as much as possible. Fruits, vegetables, legumes, and grains won’t have the long list of ingredients that packaged and processed foods often do.</li>
      <li>Cook at home as much as you can. This way, you have more control over the food you’re eating.</li>
      <li>Say no to GMOs and to the products of factory farms.</li>
      <li>Sign petitions (for example via the Center for Food Safety) to push for safer food policy.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      The good news is, you don’t have to wait for the U.S. FDA or USDA to change policy for you to make informed
      choices about what you eat and feed to your family. Every bite you take is a chance to take a stand for a
      safer and healthier life.
