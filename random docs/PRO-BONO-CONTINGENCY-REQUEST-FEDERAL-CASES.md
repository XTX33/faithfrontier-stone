**Date:** December 21, 2025  
**From:** Devon Tyler Barber, Pro Se  
**Re:** Request for Pro Bono or Contingency Representation in Federal Civil Rights Actions

---

## INTRODUCTION

I am a pro se litigant currently managing eleven (11) active civil rights cases across New Jersey state and federal courts. While I have achieved notable procedural victories—including Track-3 complex case designation, Order to Show Cause with temporary restraints, fee waivers, and successful counterclaims—the burden of prosecuting federal civil rights actions without counsel is unsustainable.

I write to request pro bono or contingency representation for **two federal civil rights cases** pending in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey. These cases involve clear violations of constitutional rights by state actors, present significant public interest issues, and offer substantial potential for monetary recovery under 42 U.S.C. § 1983.

---

## WHY THESE CASES MATTER

### **Beyond Personal Relief: Constitutional Accountability**

These federal actions are not merely about compensating one individual for past wrongs—they seek to **vindicate constitutional principles** that protect all citizens from government overreach. When police departments, municipalities, and state agencies operate without accountability, the constitutional framework designed to restrain government power becomes meaningless.

**Every successful § 1983 action:**
- Deters future misconduct by government actors
- Educates law enforcement on constitutional boundaries
- Provides judicial precedent protecting citizen rights
- Shifts the cost of unconstitutional conduct from victims to violators

### **The David vs. Goliath Reality**

As a pro se plaintiff facing well-resourced municipal defendants with experienced litigation teams, I have:
- ✓ Survived motions to dismiss
- ✓ Obtained preliminary relief (OTSC with restraints)
- ✓ Initiated comprehensive discovery
- ✓ Filed detailed legal memoranda with constitutional analysis
- ✓ Achieved Track-3 complex case designation

**But federal civil rights litigation requires:**
- Expertise in qualified immunity doctrine
- Knowledge of local federal rules and judges
- Resources for expert witnesses (use of force, police practices)
- Discovery management (ESI, depositions, privilege disputes)
- Trial experience before federal juries

**I cannot provide this alone.** These cases deserve professional representation to reach their full potential.

## CASE 1: USDJ-1-22-CV-06206

### **Case Information**
- **Court:** United States District Court, District of New Jersey
- **Docket:** 1:22-cv-06206
- **Originally Filed:** October 9, 2022
- **Motion to Reopen Filed:** August 27, 2025
- **Status:** Awaiting ruling on Rule 60(b) motion to reopen
- **Cause of Action:** 42 U.S.C. § 1983 (federal civil rights)

### **Background**

This case arises from police misconduct that resulted in constitutional violations including:
- Fourth Amendment violations (unreasonable seizure/excessive force)
- Fourteenth Amendment due process violations
- State-created danger doctrine
- Municipal liability (Monell claims for policy/custom)

**Original Case:** Filed October 2022 with comprehensive complaint, police report, and documentary evidence. Case was dismissed (circumstances requiring review of docket).

**Reopening Motion (August 2025):** Filed comprehensive Rule 60(b) motion including:
- Amended Complaint addressing deficiencies
- Memorandum in Support (detailed legal analysis)
- Declaration under penalty of perjury
- Proposed Order
- Certificate of Service

### **Legal Strength**

**Procedural Posture:**
- Rule 60(b) motions are difficult but not impossible
- 3-year gap requires strong justification (newly discovered evidence, manifest injustice)
- District of New Jersey has granted Rule 60(b) relief in civil rights cases where justice demands

**Substantive Claims:**
- Police report provides contemporaneous documentation
- Constitutional violations are time-barred if reopening denied
- Federal civil rights violations implicate qualified immunity (complex legal doctrine)
- Municipal liability under Monell requires showing of policy/custom/failure to train

**Damages Potential:**
- § 1983 compensatory damages (pain/suffering, emotional distress, lost wages)
- § 1983 punitive damages (if malice/reckless indifference shown)
- Attorney's fees under 42 U.S.C. § 1988 (prevailing party statute)
- Nominal damages available even without significant injury

### **Why This Case Needs Counsel**

1. **Qualified Immunity Defense:** Defendants will assert qualified immunity, requiring sophisticated analysis of "clearly established law" at time of violation. This doctrine is one of the most complex in civil rights litigation.

2. **Discovery Management:** Police body-worn camera footage, CAD logs, training records, and internal affairs files require formal discovery and potential litigation over disclosure.

3. **Expert Witnesses:** Use of force expert, police practices expert, or municipal policy expert may be necessary for trial.

4. **Rule 60(b) Briefing:** Reopening motion likely requires supplemental briefing and oral argument before judge—significant procedural burden.

5. **Municipal Defendants:** Well-funded defense with experienced § 1983 defense counsel.

### **Contingency Viability**

**Fee Recovery:** 42 U.S.C. § 1988 authorizes prevailing plaintiff to recover attorney's fees from defendants. This makes § 1983 cases suitable for contingency representation.

**Damages:** Depending on severity of constitutional violations:
- Excessive force cases: $25,000-$500,000+ (depending on injury)
- Unlawful arrest/detention: $10,000-$100,000
- Municipal liability: Potentially higher (institutional reform)
- Punitive damages: Significant deterrent value

**Settlement Likelihood:** Many § 1983 cases settle pre-trial to avoid:
- Public disclosure of misconduct
- Jury verdicts (often higher than settlements)
- Attorney's fee exposure
- Judicial findings of constitutional violations

### **Public Interest Value**

This case is not about money—it's about **accountability**. Police misconduct thrives in darkness. Federal civil rights actions shine light on patterns of abuse, forcing municipalities to reform policies, retrain officers, and compensate victims.

**Every § 1983 judgment or settlement:**
- Goes into public record
- Influences future police training
- Deters similar misconduct
- Vindicates constitutional rights

## CASE 2: USDJ-1-25-CV-15641

### **Case Information**
- **Court:** United States District Court, District of New Jersey
- **Docket:** 1:25-cv-15641
- **Filed:** September 9, 2025
- **Status:** Early pleading stage
- **Cause of Action:** Federal Civil Rights (likely 42 U.S.C. § 1983)

### **Background**

This is a **newly filed** federal civil rights action arising from recent constitutional violations by state actors. Case is in early stages with:
- Complaint filed September 2025
- Demurrer and Abatement filed (addressing anticipated defenses)
- Service documentation

### **Legal Strength**

**Timing:** Case is **fresh**—statute of limitations not an issue, evidence is recent, witnesses' memories are clear.

**Procedural Posture:**
- Early stage allows for strategic development
- Discovery can be shaped from outset
- Opportunity to develop factual record properly
- No prior dismissal to overcome

**Substantive Claims (preliminary assessment):**
- Constitutional violations by government actors
- Likely Fourth Amendment and/or Fourteenth Amendment claims
- Possible First Amendment retaliation
- Municipal liability potential

**Damages Potential:**
- Recent violations = calculable damages
- Ongoing harm possible (injunctive relief)
- Emotional distress damages
- Economic damages (lost wages, property damage)
- Punitive damages available
- Attorney's fees under § 1988

### **Why This Case Needs Counsel**

1. **Early Stage Advantage:** With counsel from the beginning, case can be properly developed:
   - Strategic complaint drafting
   - Comprehensive discovery planning
   - Early settlement posture
   - Avoiding procedural pitfalls

2. **Federal Procedure:** Pro se litigants face significant disadvantage in federal court:
   - Complex discovery rules
   - E-discovery (ESI) requirements
   - Expert disclosure deadlines
   - Summary judgment practice
   - Trial preparation

3. **Qualified Immunity:** Same challenge as Case 1—doctrine requires specialized knowledge

4. **Municipal Defendants:** Government entities have litigation budgets, experienced counsel, and institutional knowledge

5. **Settlement Leverage:** Experienced civil rights attorney can negotiate from strength, knowing case value and defendant's exposure

### **Contingency Viability**

**Fee Recovery:** § 1988 attorney's fees make this case suitable for contingency

**Fresh Case = Lower Risk:**
- No prior dismissal
- Statute of limitations intact
- Evidence preservation timeline favorable
- Witnesses available

**Settlement Probability:** Early-stage cases often settle after initial discovery when defendants realize:
- Plaintiff has counsel (signals seriousness)
- Discovery will expose misconduct
- Trial risk vs. settlement value
- Attorney's fee exposure accumulating

### **Public Interest Value**

**Recent violations** require **immediate accountability**. When government actors violate constitutional rights and face no consequences, the message is clear: **citizen rights are negotiable**.

This case represents an opportunity to:
- Deter ongoing misconduct
- Establish precedent for future violations
- Compensate a victim of government abuse
- Vindicate constitutional principles

## WHY CONTINGENCY REPRESENTATION IS APPROPRIATE

### **Attorney's Fee Statute: 42 U.S.C. § 1988**

Unlike most civil cases, **civil rights actions have built-in fee recovery**:

> "(b) Attorney's fees. In any action or proceeding to enforce a provision of sections 1981, 1981a, 1982, 1983, 1985, and 1986 of this title... the court, in its discretion, may allow the prevailing party, other than the United States, a reasonable attorney's fee as part of the costs..."

**This means:**
- Prevailing plaintiff recovers fees from defendants
- Fees are calculated at "reasonable hourly rate" (often $300-$600/hour)
- Contingency attorney gets paid by defendants if plaintiff wins
- No risk to plaintiff (contingency fee comes from recovery)
- Defendants pay both damages AND attorney's fees

### **Standard Contingency Terms**

Civil rights cases typically settle/resolve with:
- **33-40% contingency fee** from damages recovery
- **100% of attorney's fees** awarded by court (paid by defendants)
- **Costs advanced** by attorney, recovered from defendants

**Example:**
- Case settles for $100,000 damages + $75,000 attorney's fees
- Attorney receives: $33,000 (contingency) + $75,000 (fees) = $108,000
- Client receives: $67,000
- Defendants pay: $175,000 total

### **Risk/Reward for Counsel**

**Risks:**
- Time investment in federal litigation
- Costs advanced (experts, depositions, filing fees)
- Qualified immunity may limit recovery
- Possibility of defense verdict

**Rewards:**
- § 1988 fee recovery significantly increases compensation
- Civil rights work is publicly recognized/prestigious
- Potential for significant damages if case is strong
- Settlement likely (municipalities avoid trial exposure)
- Two cases = portfolio approach (diversified risk)
