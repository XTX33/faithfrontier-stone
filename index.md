      An open ledger standing at the crossroads of <strong>law, faith, and public stewardship</strong> —
      translating New Jersey case files, wage and benefits fights, prolonged detention, and
      the bureaucracies behind them into language anyone can audit.

    <p class="hero-footnote">
      Authored by a New Jersey tradesman and pro se litigant who spent <strong>108 days in custody before seeing a judge</strong>,
      challenged wage theft and benefits denials, and now publishes every document in daylight.

      <p>
        These aren’t remote meditations. Each reflection is forged under
        <strong>real pressure</strong>: lost wages, stolen time, broken promises, and the struggle
        to stay rooted in Scripture while navigating dockets and deadlines.

        Agencies do not merely shuffle paperwork; they decide futures. Here you can examine how
        toll authorities, motor vehicle agencies, welfare offices, and courts handle
        data, debt, detention, and discretion — and where they fracture the public trust.

  <h2>Why Faith Frontier Exists</h2>
  <p>
    Faith Frontier emerged when rumors, political speech, and misread records were treated as fact —
    when a tradesman and small-business owner was held for months before a hearing, when wage claims
    and benefits decisions moved faster on paper than in the world, and when conscience had to fight
    to remain awake.
  </p>
  <p>
    This project turns that ordeal outward. It works to reconcile
    <strong>due process, public record, and spiritual honesty</strong> — revealing what occurs
    not only in opinions and press releases, but in the filings, orders, and delays that contour
    an ordinary life.
  </p>
  <p>
    We hold that justice must be accessible, comprehensible, and compassionate — that the law
    should be measured not merely by what it permits, but by what it does to the people it touches.

  <h2>How to Use This Site</h2>
  <div class="how-grid">
    <article class="how-step">
      <h3>1. Start with a Case</h3>
      <p>
        Visit the <a href="{{ '/cases/' | relative_url }}">Cases index</a> and choose a matter —
        perhaps <strong>NJTA v. Barber</strong> or a Special Civil Part dispute.
        Each case page lays out filings chronologically and links to the original PDFs.
      </p>
    </article>
    <article class="how-step">
      <h3>2. Read the Plain-English Notes</h3>
      <p>
        Under each case, follow summaries that explain what a complaint, counterclaim,
        motion, or order <em>actually accomplishes</em>, and how it fits into the wider timeline
        — including wage conflicts, benefits appeals, or 108 days of pre-hearing custody.
