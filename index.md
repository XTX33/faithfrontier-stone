        Faithful Stewardship for New Jersey
      </h1>
      <p class="hero-lead">
        Faith Frontier exists to uphold a sacred public trust—giving New Jersey residents the clarity, courage, and tools to defend due process, honor conscience, and pursue real restoration. We document hard cases with precision, stand beside families as they navigate complex systems, and keep every action surrendered to Yeshua the Messiah, so that justice is not only lawful, but holy.

          <span class="hero-highlight__label">Due process clarity</span>
          <p>We translate legal systems into human language. Case journals document what really happens — in courts, agencies, housing, and everyday disputes — so ordinary people aren’t lost in procedures designed to confuse them. Clarity is protection. Truth is due process.</p>

        <article class="hero-highlight">
          <span class="hero-highlight__label">Sanctuary stewardship</span>
          <p>People deserve safe places to live, work, and rebuild. FaithFrontier seeks to help chart practical, faith-rooted pathways toward housing stability, lawful work, and community sanctuaries — especially for those navigating hardship, homelessness, or unfair systems. Stewardship means we take care of each other as image-bearers, not case numbers.</p>

        <article class="hero-highlight">
          <span class="hero-highlight__label">Covenant Equity</span>
          <p>We create shared documentation, transparent records, and covenant-level accountability so neighbors, landlords, contractors, and agencies operate with dignity and fairness. Equity here isn’t politics — it’s righteousness, responsibility, and honest workmanship.</p>
        </article>
        <article class="hero-highlight">
          <span class="hero-highlight__label">Witness Beyond Borders</span>
          <p>Local New Jersey struggles carry global meaning. Every case journal, restored life, and repaired home becomes testimony — a small but real witness of Christ’s justice, patience, and mercy reaching beyond our state lines. Faith Frontier is local in place, universal in purpose.</p>

    <p class="section-lead">
      Faith Frontier is an ecclesiastical, faith-rooted public trust committed to New Jersey's people. We acknowledge the
      harms we have witnessed -- confusing hearings, paperwork traps, agencies that miss humanity -- and we turn those
      lessons into a constructive path forward.
    </p>
    <p style="color: var(--color-muted);">
      We follow Christ's call to justice, mercy, and humility (cf. Matthew 5–7), anchoring our public recordkeeping in
      the witness tradition of the Geneva Bible while inviting transparent comparison across translations.
    </p>
    <p>
      We are building an ethical advocacy culture: documenting cases, equipping residents with plain-language guidance,
      and collaborating with churches, community leaders, professionals, and officials who want due process to work for
      everyone. Our focus is restoration, stewardship, and public trust.
