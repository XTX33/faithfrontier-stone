## When Press Is Removed, Trust Is Lost  

### Public Access, Due Process, and the Misuse of "Private Property" Claims

### Executive Summary

Public trust erodes when journalists and observers are excluded from **public-facing commercial spaces**—such as hotel lobbies—by reflexive invocations of “private property,” especially without clear, neutral rules or due process. Lawful authority does not end at a lobby door open to the public; it is constrained by **civil-rights statutes, constitutional principles, and state law**.

---

## 1. “Private Property” Is Not a Magic Phrase

Not all private property is treated the same. **Properties held open to the public for commerce**—including hotels—are subject to **civil-rights obligations** and limits on arbitrary exclusion. A hotel lobby is not a residence; it is a **public-facing commercial space**.

Under **Title II of the Civil Rights Act of 1964**, places of public accommodation (hotels explicitly included) may not discriminate and must apply policies **evenhandedly**. While owners retain reasonable rules of conduct, **blanket or retaliatory exclusions**—particularly against press engaged in lawful newsgathering—invite scrutiny.^1

## 2. New Jersey’s Broader Speech Protections

New Jersey recognizes **broader free-expression rights** under its state constitution than the federal floor. In *State v. Schmid*, the New Jersey Supreme Court adopted a balancing test for expressive activity on privately owned property **open to the public**, considering:

1) the nature of the property,  
2) the extent of public invitation, and  
3) the purpose of the expression.^2

Hotel lobbies—designed to invite the public for lodging, meetings, and services—fall closer to the “public invitation” end of this spectrum than to a private home.

## 3. Trespass Orders Require a Lawful Predicate

A **trespass order** is not self-justifying. Law enforcement must identify:

- a **clear, lawful request** to leave,
- a **legitimate, neutral reason** (not viewpoint or retaliation),
- and **adequate notice** allowing compliance.

Using trespass authority to remove press absent disruptive conduct risks **prior restraint** and **retaliation** concerns, particularly where coverage involves matters of public interest.^3

---

## 4. Police Are Not Private Security

Police authority is constrained by **constitutional neutrality**. When officers enforce exclusions at the direction of private actors, they must independently assess legality. Acting as de facto private security—without neutral evaluation—exposes municipalities to liability and undermines legitimacy.

---

## 5. Transparency Is the Antidote

Excluding press from public-facing spaces **inflates suspicion**. When access is curtailed without explanation, the public reasonably infers concealment. The result is not order—it is distrust.

---

## Conclusion

Public order is strengthened by **clear rules, neutral enforcement, and transparency**. Treating every open lobby as a fortress and every inquiry as trespass undermines civil liberties and public confidence. The law provides tools to manage disruption **without** suppressing lawful observation.

## Footnotes (Law-Review Style)

1. Civil Rights Act of 1964, Title II, 42 U.S.C. § 2000a (public accommodations; hotels included).  
2. *State v. Schmid*, 84 N.J. 535 (1980).
