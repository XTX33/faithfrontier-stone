# The Faith Frontier Logo

### Trinity • Witness • Stewardship • Design Integrity

The Faith Frontier logo is not a decorative brand mark.  
It is a **Christ-centered ecclesiastical seal**—a visual confession that unites Christian theology, public stewardship, and design integrity.

The emblem was created to communicate **who we are, what we serve, and under whose authority we work**—quietly, clearly, and without marketing excess.

---

## What the Logo Is Made Of

The seal is rendered as a layered SVG and consists of:

- A **gold circular halo**
- A **white central cross**
- **Two green crosses** positioned behind the center

Each element is intentional.  
Together they bear witness to the **Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit**, expressed relationally rather than abstractly.

---

## The Gold Halo — God the Father

**Meaning:** Eternity, sovereignty, and divine covering.

The unbroken gold circle forms the outer boundary of the mark.

- The circle symbolizes eternity and completeness.
- Gold has long represented holiness, kingship, and authority within Christian tradition.
- As a surrounding form, it expresses God the Father as the source and sustainer of all things.

> “Thus says the One who is high and lifted up, who inhabits eternity…” (Isaiah 57:15)

**Design note:**  
The halo establishes the sacred boundary of the seal. It must remain intact, unbroken, and visually dominant.

---

## The White Cross — Jesus Christ

**Meaning:** Redemption, truth, and resurrection.

At the center of the seal stands a white cross.

- White signifies purity, mercy, and new life.
- The cross is intentionally recognizable—not abstracted—affirming the historic Christian confession.
- Positioned within the gold halo, the cross represents **the Son revealed within the Father’s will**.

> “I am the light of the world.” (John 8:12)

**Design note:**  
The cross is proportioned for legibility at all sizes. Its form, color, and placement must not be altered.

---

## The Two Green Crosses — Lived Faith and Renewal

**Meaning:** New creation, faithful witness, and the fruit of the Spirit.

Behind the central cross are two green crosses.

- Green symbolizes life, growth, restoration, and stewardship.
- The paired forms reflect the biblical principle of **two witnesses**.
- They represent the Spirit’s work made visible through lived faith—love of God and love of neighbor.

> “If anyone is in Christ, there is a new creation.” (2 Corinthians 5:17)

These crosses remain behind the central cross to express a key truth:  
**all renewal flows from Christ and never replaces Him.**

**Clarification:**  
The two green crosses do not imply multiple spirits. The Holy Spirit is one. The paired forms represent witness and fruit, not division.

---

## Sacred Order and Composition

The geometry of the seal is deliberately restrained:

1. **The Father surrounds** (gold halo)  
2. **The Son reveals** (white cross)  
3. **The Spirit animates** (green witness and renewal)

This order reflects Christian theology visually, without requiring explanation.

---

## Color Meaning

| Color | Symbolism |
|------|----------|
| **Gold** | Holiness, authority, eternity |
| **White** | Truth, mercy, resurrection |
| **Green** | Life, growth, stewardship |

High contrast must be preserved to maintain clarity and reverence.

## What the Logo Confesses

The Faith Frontier seal quietly declares:

- **The Father** who covers and sustains  
- **The Son** who redeems and reveals  
- **The Spirit** who renews and sends  

It does not advertise.  
It does not shout.  
It **bears witness**.

Where it appears, it signals that Faith Frontier’s work—whether in land, housing, records, or community—is undertaken **under God’s authority, through Christ, and by the Spirit’s life-giving power**.

## Closing

The Faith Frontier logo is not a brand invention.  
It is a **visual confession**, offered with humility, restraint, and care.

It exists to serve truth, not attention—and to remain faithful long after trends fade.
