## The Faith Frontier Logo

### Trinity • Witness • Stewardship • Design Integrity

The Faith Frontier emblem is not a decorative brand mark.  
It is a **Christ-centered ecclesiastical seal**—a visual confession that unites theology, stewardship, and public trust.

Rendered as a layered SVG, the seal is composed of:

- a **gold circular halo**,
- a **white central Cross**, and
- **two green crosses** set behind the central form.

Each element is intentional. Each carries doctrinal meaning.  
Together, they bear witness to the **Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit**—not abstractly, but relationally and missionally.

---

## The Gold Halo — The Father’s Covering

**Represents:** God the Father — eternal, sovereign, holy.

The unbroken gold ring forms the outer boundary of the mark.

- Its circular form signifies eternity, completeness, and unoriginated being.
- Gold has long signified kingship, sanctity, and divine authority within Christian tradition.
- As a surrounding “covering,” the halo expresses the Father’s sustaining presence: the source from whom all life proceeds and in whom all work is held.

> “Thus says the One who is high and lifted up, who inhabits eternity…” (Isaiah 57:15)

**Design integrity:**  
The halo establishes visual hierarchy and sacred boundary. It must remain unbroken, unaltered, and above all other elements in the seal.

---

## The White Cross — The Son Revealed

**Represents:** Jesus Christ — crucified, risen, and present.

At the center stands the white Cross.

- White communicates purity, mercy, and resurrection.
- The Cross is not stylized into abstraction; it remains clearly recognizable.
- Placed within the gold halo, the Cross reads as **light proceeding from the Father**, revealing the heart of God through self-giving love.

> “I am the light of the world.” (John 8:12)  
> “He is the radiance of the glory of God.” (Hebrews 1:3)

**Design integrity:**  
Proportions are tuned for legibility at small sizes without losing reverence. Arm lengths, stroke widths, and corner radii are fixed and must not be altered.

## The Two Green Crosses — The Spirit’s Work Made Visible

**Represent:** New creation, lived faith, and neighbor-care through the Holy Spirit.

Set behind the central Cross are two green crosses.

- Green signifies life, growth, cultivation, and stewardship.
- The pair forms a **double witness**—echoing the biblical pattern of testimony and covenant faithfulness.
- Together, they represent the Spirit’s ongoing work: renewing people, restoring land, and forming communities shaped by love of God and neighbor.

> “If anyone is in Christ, there is a new creation.” (2 Corinthians 5:17)  
> “You shall love the Lord your God… and your neighbor as yourself.” (Matthew 22:37–39)

Positioned behind the white Cross, the green crosses affirm a crucial truth:  
**all renewal flows from Christ and never replaces Him.**

**Design integrity:**  
The green forms are intentionally subdued. They support the central Cross and must never compete with it visually or symbolically.

**Trinitarian clarity:** The two green crosses do not represent multiple spirits. They represent a double witness and the fruit of lived faith—Spirit-made renewal expressed in love of God and neighbor—while the Holy Spirit remains one.

---

## Composition and Sacred Order

The seal’s geometry is deliberately restrained.

- The halo defines the sacred boundary.
- The white Cross occupies the visual center.
- The green crosses align to the same grid and remain partially obscured.

This ordering reflects theological reality:
**the Father surrounds, the Son reveals, the Spirit animates.**

---

## Color Theology

- **Gold** — divine authority, holiness, eternity  
- **White** — mercy, truth, resurrection  
- **Green** — life, growth, stewardship, sanctuary  

High contrast is required. When placed over imagery, a neutral field must be used to preserve legibility and reverence.

---

## Usage Standards

### Do

- Preserve layer order and proportions.
- Use official color values.
- Maintain clear space equal to the halo's thickness.

### Do Not

- Recolor the Cross or halo.
- Remove the green crosses from the seal variant.
- Distort, outline, or decorate the mark.
- Place on visually noisy or low-contrast backgrounds.

## What the Seal Confesses

The Faith Frontier logo is a confession rendered in form:

- The **Father** who covers and sustains  
- The **Son** who reveals and redeems  
- The **Spirit** who renews and sends  

It does not shout.  
It does not market.  
It **bears witness**.

Where it appears, it quietly declares that our work—whether in records, housing, land, or community—is undertaken **under God’s authority, through Christ, and by the Spirit’s life-giving power**.
