    <h2>Connecting the Dots</h2>
    <p class="lead">
      Every case filed through Faith Frontier raises legal questions — but beneath those questions
      are deeper truths about how power should be exercised, how contracts should be honored,
      and how government must serve rather than exploit the people.
    </p>
    <p>
      This page reveals the <strong>common threads</strong> that run through all these matters:
      principles that transcend any single docket and point toward God's purpose for law,
      governance, and human relationships.

    <h2>Five Core Revelations</h2>
    <p class="lead">
      Across criminal, civil, federal, and administrative cases, five timeless principles
      emerge with remarkable consistency. These are the revelations that God has used these
      trials to teach and to witness:

      <article class="revelation-card" id="revelation-1">
        <h3><span class="revelation-number">1.</span> The Public Trust Doctrine</h3>
        <p class="revelation-principle">
          <strong>Principle:</strong> Government agencies are fiduciaries, not owners.
          They must administer public resources for the benefit of the people, not as
          revenue-generating enterprises.
        </p>
        <p class="revelation-scripture">
          <strong>Scripture:</strong> "The earth is the LORD's, and everything in it,
          the world, and all who live in it." <em>— Psalm 24:1</em>
        </p>
        <div class="revelation-cases">
          <p><strong>Revealed in these cases:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li><a href="{{ '/cases/njta-v-barber/' | relative_url }}">NJTA v. Barber</a> —
                Toll authorities must enforce fees proportionally, not punitively</li>
            <li><a href="{{ '/cases/atl-l-002794-25/' | relative_url }}">Barber v. Tumelty</a> —
                Attorneys hold client trust as fiduciaries</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <p class="revelation-insight">
          <strong>Why it matters:</strong> When public servants forget they are stewards,
          they become tyrants. The public trust doctrine reminds every agency and officer
          that their authority is borrowed from the people and must be used for the people's
          benefit.
        </p>
      </article>

      <article class="revelation-card" id="revelation-2">
        <h3><span class="revelation-number">2.</span> Proportionality in Commerce</h3>
        <p class="revelation-principle">
          <strong>Principle:</strong> Penalties and fees must be proportional to the offense
          and actual costs. A 24-to-1 ratio of fees to tolls is not justice — it is exploitation.
        </p>
        <p class="revelation-scripture">
          <strong>Scripture:</strong> "Do not use dishonest standards when measuring length,
          weight or quantity. Use honest scales and honest weights." <em>— Leviticus 19:35–36</em>
        </p>
        <div class="revelation-cases">
          <p><strong>Revealed in these cases:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li><a href="{{ '/cases/njta-v-barber/' | relative_url }}">NJTA v. Barber</a> —
                $204 in tolls, $4,905 in fees = excessive and punitive</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <p class="revelation-insight">
          <strong>Why it matters:</strong> Commerce without conscience becomes predation.
          The law must protect citizens from disproportionate penalties that punish poverty
          and enrich bureaucracy. This principle applies to toll fees, court costs, and
          any government-imposed financial burden.

      <article class="revelation-card" id="revelation-3">
        <h3><span class="revelation-number">3.</span> Due Process & Conscience</h3>
        <p class="revelation-principle">
          <strong>Principle:</strong> Fair process is not a technicality — it is a sacred right.
          Due process means notice, opportunity to be heard, and decisions based on evidence,
          not assumptions or convenience.
        </p>
        <p class="revelation-scripture">
          <strong>Scripture:</strong> "Speak up for those who cannot speak for themselves,
          for the rights of all who are destitute. Speak up and judge fairly; defend the
          rights of the poor and needy." <em>— Proverbs 31:8–9</em>
        </p>
        <div class="revelation-cases">
          <p><strong>Revealed in these cases:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li><a href="{{ '/cases/barber-nj-pcr-2022/' | relative_url }}">State v. Barber (PCR)</a> —
                Ineffective counsel deprives defendants of fair trial</li>
            <li><a href="{{ '/cases/a-000308-25/' | relative_url }}">Barber v. State (A-000308-25)</a> —
                Procedural fairness in appellate process</li>
            <li><a href="{{ '/cases/street-crossing-pcr-appeal/' | relative_url }}">Street-Crossing PCR Appeal (A-000313-25)</a> —
                Notice and opportunity to challenge street-level detention and charges</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <p class="revelation-insight">
          <strong>Why it matters:</strong> God's justice is not arbitrary. It requires truth,
          transparency, and the opportunity to be heard. When courts deny process, they deny
          the image of God in each person — the capacity for reason, response, and redemption.

      <article class="revelation-card" id="revelation-4">
        <h3><span class="revelation-number">4.</span> Fiduciary Duty & Good Faith</h3>
        <p class="revelation-principle">
          <strong>Principle:</strong> Those entrusted with power — whether attorneys, judges,
          or public officials — must exercise that power in good faith, serving the interests
          of those they are sworn to protect.
        </p>
        <p class="revelation-scripture">
          <strong>Scripture:</strong> "Now it is required that those who have been given
          a trust must prove faithful." <em>— 1 Corinthians 4:2</em>
        </p>
        <div class="revelation-cases">
          <p><strong>Revealed in these cases:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li><a href="{{ '/cases/atl-l-002794-25/' | relative_url }}">Barber v. Tumelty</a> —
                Attorney's duty to investigate, preserve defenses, and communicate honestly</li>
            <li><a href="{{ '/cases/njta-v-barber/' | relative_url }}">NJTA v. Barber</a> —
                Public agency's duty to serve, not exploit, the traveling public</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <p class="revelation-insight">
          <strong>Why it matters:</strong> Betrayal of trust is not just a legal violation —
          it is a moral corruption that undermines the entire system of justice. When those
          with power act in bad faith, the vulnerable have nowhere to turn.

      <article class="revelation-card" id="revelation-5">
        <h3><span class="revelation-number">5.</span> Stewardship Over Exploitation</h3>
        <p class="revelation-principle">
          <strong>Principle:</strong> Government exists to serve and steward, not to dominate
          and extract. Every law, fee, and enforcement action must be measured against this
          foundational purpose.
        </p>
        <p class="revelation-scripture">
          <strong>Scripture:</strong> "Whoever wants to become great among you must be your
          servant, and whoever wants to be first must be slave of all." <em>— Mark 10:43–44</em>
        </p>
        <div class="revelation-cases">
          <p><strong>Revealed in these cases:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li><a href="{{ '/cases/njta-v-barber/' | relative_url }}">NJTA v. Barber</a> —
                Toll enforcement as stewardship vs. revenue extraction</li>
            <li><strong>All PCR cases</strong> —
                Criminal justice system must serve rehabilitation, not merely punishment</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <p class="revelation-insight">
          <strong>Why it matters:</strong> When government forgets it is a steward, it becomes
          a predator. The principle of stewardship demands that every exercise of power be
          justified by service to the common good, not by the convenience or profit of the
          state.

    <h2>How the Cases Connect</h2>
    <p class="lead">
      These are not random legal disputes. They are interconnected challenges to the same
      systemic problems: government overreach, professional betrayal, and the erosion of
      conscience in public and private institutions.
    </p>

    <div class="grid-2">
      <div>
        <h3>The Criminal Justice Thread</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>State v. Barber (ATL-22-002292, ATL-22-002313, ATL-24-001934)</strong> —
              Original criminal cases and post-conviction challenges</li>
          <li><strong>Barber v. Tumelty (ATL-L-002794-25)</strong> —
              Legal malpractice stemming from ineffective representation in criminal matters</li>
          <li><strong>Federal Civil Rights (1:22-cv-06206, 1:25-cv-15641)</strong> —
              Constitutional violations during arrest, detention, and prosecution</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="text-muted">
          <strong>Common theme:</strong> When the system fails to protect the accused,
          every subsequent proceeding is tainted. Justice requires accountability at every
          level — from arrest to trial to post-conviction review.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h3>The Public Trust Thread</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>NJTA v. Barber (ATL-DC-007956-25)</strong> —
              Toll authority overreach and disproportionate fees</li>
          <li><strong>Appeals (A-000308-25, A-000313-25)</strong> —
              Procedural fairness and access to appellate review</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="text-muted">
          <strong>Common theme:</strong> Public agencies must act as fiduciaries, not
          revenue collectors. The same principle that limits toll fees also limits court
          costs, probation conditions, and any government-imposed burden on citizens.
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="revelation-timeline">
      <h3>Timeline of Revelation</h3>
      <p>
        God reveals truth progressively. The cases documented here span multiple years
        and touch multiple areas of law, but they all converge on the same core principles:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>2022–2024:</strong> Criminal prosecutions expose systemic due-process failures</li>
        <li><strong>2025 (early):</strong> Post-conviction petitions reveal ineffective counsel and withheld evidence</li>
        <li><strong>2025 (mid):</strong> Federal civil rights actions assert constitutional violations</li>
        <li><strong>2025 (late):</strong> Civil malpractice and toll cases connect public-trust failures across systems</li>
      </ol>
      <p class="text-muted">
        Each case builds on the last, revealing a pattern of institutional failure that
        cannot be dismissed as individual error. This is systemic — and the remedy must be
        systemic as well.

    <h2>God's Purpose Revealed</h2>
    <p class="lead">
      Why has God allowed one tradesman to face so many legal battles? Not for punishment,
      but for purpose. Not to destroy, but to reveal and to teach.

      <article class="purpose-card">
        <h3>To Witness Truth</h3>
        <p>
          Every filing, every brief, every discovery request is an act of witness — bearing
          testimony to how the system actually works, not how it claims to work. God uses
          these cases to document injustice so that others may learn and reform.
        </p>
      </article>

      <article class="purpose-card">
        <h3>To Teach Stewardship</h3>
        <p>
          The principles revealed in these cases are not new. They echo ancient law: the
          Year of Jubilee, the prohibition on usury, the command to use honest weights.
          God is teaching that stewardship, not exploitation, must govern both commerce
          and government.

      <article class="purpose-card">
        <h3>To Build Faith</h3>
        <p>
          Legal battles test faith like few other trials. They demand patience, endurance,
          and trust in God's justice even when human courts fail. Through these cases,
          God builds character and reveals His faithfulness in the midst of adversity.
        </p>
      </article>

      <article class="purpose-card">
        <h3>To Serve Others</h3>
        <p>
          Every precedent set, every principle clarified, every document published serves
          not just one litigant but countless others who face similar injustices. God uses
          one man's trials to create a roadmap for many.

      These cases are not accidents. They are appointments — divine opportunities to reveal
      truth, to challenge injustice, and to point both courts and citizens back toward the

      character: just, merciful, and faithful.
