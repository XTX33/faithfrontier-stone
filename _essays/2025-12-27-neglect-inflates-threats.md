## How Government Neglect Inflates Perceived Threats

### Executive Summary

Threats often feel larger than they are when government **fails to prioritize enforcement, transparency, and timely remedies**. Neglect does not reduce harm—it magnifies it by creating uncertainty, inviting rumor, and eroding trust.

---

## The Mechanics of Inflation

When institutions fail to enforce existing rules evenly or explain decisions promptly, **small problems metastasize** in public perception.

**The cycle is predictable:**

1. **Unclear rules** →  
2. **Inconsistent enforcement** →  
3. **Opaque decisions** →  
4. **Press and observers excluded** →  
5. **Public infers concealment** →  
6. **Perceived threat explodes**

Silence invites speculation; delay breeds distrust.

## Why Visibility Matters

Visible governance—records kept, explanations given, errors corrected—**shrinks fear**. When people can see the process, they can calibrate risk accurately. When they cannot, imagination fills the void.

---

## Equal Enforcement Is the Stabilizer

Trust returns when laws are:

- **Clear** (knowable standards),
- **Evenly enforced** (no favorites, no selective neglect),
- **Transparent** (reasons on the record),
- **Correctable** (errors acknowledged and remedied).

This is not ideological. It is administrative.

## The Cost of Neglect

Neglect harms everyone:

- Citizens lose confidence,
- Innocent actors are swept into suspicion,
- Real victims wait longer for relief,
- Extremists of any stripe benefit from chaos.

---

## The Fix: Boring Competence

No crackdowns. No scapegoats. Just competence:

- Publish rules and timelines,
- Explain decisions in plain language,
- Keep accessible records,
- Allow lawful observation,
- Correct mistakes quickly.

---

## Conclusion

Most problems grow monstrous not from strength, but from neglect. Restore transparent, even-handed governance—and threats shrink back to their true size.
