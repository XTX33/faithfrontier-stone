        <h2>Why Leave Babylon?</h2>
        <p>
          God never made you a number or a product. <strong>Babylon</strong> is the Bible’s name for every system that trades people for profit.
          Jesus paid for your freedom (1 Cor 6 : 20) and calls you to walk in it.
          <em>Leaving Babylon</em> means three simple things:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Know the truth.</strong> You were made to serve God, not a corporation.</li>
          <li><strong>Break silent contracts.</strong> Reserve your rights on any form you sign (<code>UCC 1-308</code>).</li>
          <li><strong>Live as a steward.</strong> Grow food, build honest work, love neighbours, teach your children.</li>

        <h2>Come Out of Her, My People</h2>
        <h3>Escaping Legal Fiction and Returning to Christ’s Authority</h3>

        <blockquote>
          <p>“Come out of her, my people, that ye be not partakers of her sins, and that ye receive not of her plagues.”<br>
          — <strong>Revelation 18 : 4, Geneva 1599</strong></p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>
          Modern society rests on <strong>legal fiction</strong>: paper names, silent contracts and commercial codes
          that override God-given liberty. From birth our identities are monetised,
          our labour securitised and our faith diverted toward state institutions.
        </p>

        <!-- 1 -->
        <h4>1&nbsp;&nbsp;The Federal Corporation</h4>
        <p>
          The Republic was converted into a <em>federal corporation</em> by the
          <strong>District of Columbia Organic Act (1871)</strong>.
          “United States” is defined in statute as a corporation
          (<a href="https://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=granuleid:USC-prelim-title28-section3002&amp;num=0" target="_blank">28 USC § 3002 (15)(A)</a>).
        </p>

        <!-- 2 -->
        <h4>2&nbsp;&nbsp;Birth-Certificate Bondage</h4>
        <p>
          A birth certificate manufactures an <strong>ALL-CAPS PERSON</strong> separated from the living child.
          That entity is pledged for debt, taxed by code and sued in admiralty courts—
          unless the living man or woman <em>reserves all rights</em>.
        </p>

        <!-- 3 -->
        <h4>3&nbsp;&nbsp;Roman &amp; Vatican Influence</h4>
        <p>
          Western civil law descends from <strong>Roman civil law</strong> and <strong>Canon law</strong>.
          Papal encyclicals such as
          <a href="https://www.vatican.va/content/francesco/en/encyclicals/documents/papa-francesco_20201003_enciclica-fratelli-tutti.html" target="_blank"><em>Fratelli Tutti</em></a>
          promote a one-world fraternity that echoes Babel, not Zion (<em>2 Th 2 : 3</em>).
        </p>

        <!-- 4 -->
        <h4>4&nbsp;&nbsp;The God We Serve Is Not “Cretin”</h4>
        <blockquote>
          <p>“For God is not the author of confusion, but of peace.” — <strong>1 Cor 14 : 33</strong></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          “Cretin” signifies defect or ignorance. The Creator is perfect, wise and holy.
          He <strong>builds</strong> where the world breaks, <strong>restores</strong> where empires enslave,
          and <strong>calls</strong> His people out of confusion into stewardship.
        </p>

        <!-- 5 -->
        <h4>5&nbsp;&nbsp;Practical Exit Steps</h4>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Signature rule</strong> – add “Without Prejudice UCC 1-308” to retain rights.</li>
          <li><strong>Private Trust / PMA</strong> – hold name, land and labour outside commercial code.</li>
          <li><strong>Notice of Use</strong> – record land improvement or patent to anchor stewardship.</li>
          <li><strong>Refuse licences</strong> that convert rights (travel, trade, worship) into privileges.</li>
        </ul>

        <!-- 6 -->
        <h4>6&nbsp;&nbsp;Return to Land &amp; Service</h4>
        <blockquote>
          <p>“And the LORD God took the man, and put him into the garden of Eden to dress it and to keep it.” — <strong>Gen 2 : 15</strong></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          Stewardship is God’s original assignment. Babylon taxes it; Christ restores it.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Grow food; share surplus.</li>
          <li>Teach Scripture, contract law and basic husbandry to family and neighbours.</li>
          <li>Trade honestly—gold, silver, barter, service—not usury.</li>
        </ul>

        <!-- Final -->
        <h4>7&nbsp;&nbsp;Final Call</h4>
        <p>
          Babylon survives on <em>silence</em> and <em>ignorance</em>.
          The Kingdom runs on <em>truth</em>. Walk away from paper chains;
          stand in the liberty Christ bought (1 Cor 6 : 20).
          Then light the path for others still adrift.

        This guide walks through how identity, title, and land became entangled in paper systems,
        and how a believer can respond without abandoning either neighbor or conscience.
        It traces the gap between what is on record and what is true before God.

      <h1>Build on the Rock — A People’s Guide to Debt &amp; Fiat Tyranny</h1>
      <blockquote>“Everyone who hears these words of Mine and does them is like a wise man who built his house <strong>on the rock</strong>.”<br>— Jesus, Matthew 7:24</blockquote>
      <p><strong>TL;DR</strong>: <em>True freedom</em> is reclaimed when we root our lives in Christ, honest work, and local provision—rejecting usury, fiat illusions, and corporate idols. What follows is a road-map to gather the scattered tribes, restore the land, and live the Kingdom now.</p>
      <hr>
      <h2 id="1-stone">1 · The Stone We Build On</h2>
      <p>[FACT] The New Testament calls Christ the “chief cornerstone” (<cite>Ephesians 2:20</cite>).<br>[INTERPRETATION] In 2025, that cornerstone translates to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Truth over trends.</li>
        <li>Work you control, land you steward.</li>
        <li>A table blessed by God, not financed by Mammon.</li>
      </ul>
      <div class="callout">
        <strong>Reality:</strong> Any claim not anchored in observable Scripture or verifiable history is labeled <code>[INTERPRETATION]</code> or <code>[OPINION]</code>. Receive, test, and build.
      </div>
      <h2 id="2-fiat">2 · The Tyranny of Fiat Debt</h2>
      <h3>2.1 What Is Fiat?</h3>
      <p>[FACT] “Fiat” currency holds value by government decree, not by an intrinsic commodity (e.g., gold).</p>
      <h3>2.2 How Debt Enslaves</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>[FACT] Average U.S. household debt exceeded <abbr title="Federal Reserve Q1 2025">$102 k</abbr> in early 2025.</li>
        <li>[INTERPRETATION] Inflation operates as a hidden tax—eroding purchasing power without a vote.</li>
        <li>[FACT] Biblical law forbids interest on loans to fellow Israelites (<cite>Deuteronomy 23:19-20</cite>).</li>
      </ul>
      <h2 id="3-roots">3 · Spiritual Roots of Usury &amp; Inflation</h2>
      <p>[OPINION] Usury is a parasite spirit—profit without labor. It mirrors the serpent’s lie: “Gain without sowing.”</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Usury multiplies fear; fear feeds control.</li>
        <li>Inflation lets governments and banks repay yesterday’s promises with tomorrow’s devalued labor.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2 id="4-homestead">4 · A Christ-Centered Homestead Economy</h2>
      <h3>4.1 Pillars</h3>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Food Sovereignty</strong>: Garden, orchard, livestock, seed-saving.</li>
        <li><strong>Local Exchange</strong>: Barter, time-banking, honest weights.</li>
        <li><strong>Skill Discipleship</strong>: Teach trades, share tools, steward apprentices.</li>
        <li><strong>Household Worship</strong>: Family altar &gt; Sunday show.</li>
      </ol>
      <h3>4.2 Practical Steps</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Convert 10 % of weekly spending into garden infrastructure.</li>
        <li>Host monthly “Barn-Raising Sabbaths” for community projects.</li>
        <li>Switch one bill (energy, phone) to a local co-op or smaller provider within 90 days.</li>

        <li><strong>Release</strong> unnecessary debt; refuse new bondage.</li>

          These are not just storms. These are spiritual mirrors. Whether sent by God, permitted by Him,
          or stirred by greedy men through limited liability schemes — the cry is clear: <strong>turn back</strong>.
        </p>
        <h3>1. Discern the Storm</h3>
        <p>How do we know if something is a sign from the LORD or a scheme of man?</p>
        <ul>
          <li>God’s signs point to repentance, righteousness, and renewal.</li>
          <li>Man’s schemes bring profit, confusion, dependence, and fear.</li>
          <li>Jesus said, <strong>“Ye shall know them by their fruits.”</strong> — <cite>Matthew 7:16, GNV</cite></li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          If tragedy leads us to love, mercy, repentance, and truth — we stand on holy ground.
          If it leads us to FEMA tents, insurance claims, and state contracts — we are standing in Babylon’s pit.
        </p>
        <h3>2. Babylon Profits from the Flood</h3>
        <p>
          Corporations do not mourn. Governments do not repent. Yet they manage disasters like contracts —
          with LLCs, federal grants, and public-private partnerships. These are not shepherds. These are merchants of control.
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            <strong>
              “The thief cometh not, but for to steal, and to kill, and to destroy:
              I am come that they might have life, and have it in abundance.”
            </strong>
          </p>
          <p><cite>— John 10:10, GNV</cite></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          The state sells recovery, but only Christ restores. The world sells insurance, but only the Kingdom provides assurance.
        </p>
        <h3>3. What Was Broken?</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>“They transgressed the Lawes”</strong> — The Ten Commandments were cast down.</li>
          <li><strong>“Changed the Ordinances”</strong> — Marriage, life, gender, rest — all inverted by pride.</li>
          <li><strong>“Broken the Everlasting Covenant”</strong> — Creation’s agreement was violated through violence, greed, and lies.</li>
        </ul>
        <blockquote>
          <p><strong>“This people honoureth me with their lips, but their heart is far from me.”</strong></p>
          <p><cite>— Matthew 15:8, GNV</cite></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          Let us not blame the land. The earth groans under us — but even now, <strong>God is willing to forgive and rebuild.</strong>
        </p>
        <h3>4. Christ: The Bridge Back</h3>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            <strong>
              “Come unto me, all ye that are weary and laden, and I will ease you. Take my yoke on you, and learn of me…
              and ye shall find rest unto your souls.”
            </strong>
          </p>
          <p><cite>— Matthew 11:28–29, GNV</cite></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          Christ is not a religion. He is the living covenant. The restorer of the broken path. He does not shame you — He calls you.
        </p>
        <p>
          Through Him, even the most lost can be found. Even the weary worker can be reborn as a steward of righteousness.
        </p>
        <h3>5. Repentance Is the Way Home</h3>
        <p>
          Repentance is not guilt. It is <strong>re-alignment</strong>. A sacred U-turn.
          Jesus (Yeshua) didn’t come to condemn you — He came to redeem what you forgot was holy:
          <strong>you, your land, your life, your work.</strong>
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <p><strong>“Except ye repent, ye shall all likewise perish.”</strong></p>
          <p><cite>— Luke 13:5, GNV</cite></p>
        </blockquote>
        <ol>
          <li>Say aloud: “Father, I’ve drifted. Help me return.”</li>
          <li>Turn away from lies — even if it’s one small act today.</li>
          <li>Touch the ground. Thank it. Steward it.</li>
          <li>Read Isaiah. Then John. Then Psalms. Hear Him.</li>
          <li>Build. Forgive. Create. Sow seeds — spiritual and physical.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>You are not too far gone. The Shepherd leaves the ninety-nine for one — and <strong>you may be that one today</strong>.</p>
        <h3>6. Take Back Your Community</h3>
        <p>Jesus didn’t outsource healing to Rome. He sent out His disciples with no bag, no permit, no license. Just truth, prayer, and authority.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>We must reclaim our food, water, shelter, and justice.</li>
          <li>We must form trusts, fellowships, and faithful trades — not LLCs of greed.</li>
          <li>We must build local, lawful, covenant-based stewardship systems — not federal dependence.</li>
        </ul>
        <blockquote>
          <p><strong>“When the righteous are in authority, the people rejoice: but when the wicked beareth rule, the people mourn.”</strong></p>
          <p><cite>— Proverbs 29:2, GNV</cite></p>
        </blockquote>
        <h3>7. What Is Tiller.Earth?</h3>
        <p>
          This is not a company. This is a covenant. A sacred frontier where tradesmen, stewards, and seekers rebuild the waste places with truth and tile, scripture and stone.
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <p><strong>“And they shall build the old waste places… and thou shalt be called, The repairer of the breach, The restorer of paths to dwell in.”</strong></p>
          <p><cite>— Isaiah 58:12, 1599 Geneva Bible</cite></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          We don’t charge to control. We labor to serve. We don’t build to impress. We build to bless.
          Not for permits. Not for pride. For the Kingdom of Heaven — on earth.
        </p>
        <h3>8. If You're Tired, You're Ready</h3>
        <p>
          If you feel broken, artificial, overwhelmed — good. It means your spirit is still alive. And it’s calling home.
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <p><strong>“The LORD is nigh unto them that are of a contrite heart: and will save such as be afflicted in spirit.”</strong></p>
          <p><cite>— Psalm 34:18, GNV</cite></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          Come walk with us. Come weep with us. Come rebuild something sacred.
          Not in a megachurch. Not in an office park. But on the soil. With your hands. With your voice. With your Christ.
        </p>

      <h1>✦ Bombs Are Not Peaceful — But Neither Is Silence in the Face of Evil</h1>
      <p><em>Published on Tiller.Earth | June 23, A.D. 2025</em></p>

      <blockquote>“Thanks MAGAts for electing someone so stupid he thinks bombs are peaceful.” – seen on my Facebook feed today…</blockquote>

      <p>A brutal reaction. Not uncommon. And not without feeling.</p>
      <p>But at Tiller.Earth, we don’t measure truth by outrage or applause. We measure it by fruit, by root, and by the law of heaven and history alike.</p>
      <p>So let’s dig beneath the noise — not to take a side, but to <strong>seek understanding</strong>, and maybe, find our footing again in a world tilting toward war.</p>

      <h2>✦ I. What Happened in Iran?</h2>
      <p>On June 21–22, 2025, coordinated strikes by U.S. and Israeli forces targeted <strong>three of Iran’s most fortified nuclear sites</strong>: Fordow, Natanz, and Isfahan (<a href="https://www.iaea.org/newscenter/pressreleases/update-on-developments-in-iran" target="_blank">IAEA press release</a>).</p>
      <p>These weren’t symbolic. They were surgical. They took down advanced enrichment centers—underground, reinforced, and accelerating uranium beyond peaceful thresholds.</p>
      <p>The operation, nick-named <strong>“Midnight Hammer,”</strong> may have bought the world time—not to celebrate violence, but to keep <strong>an unholy weapon from an unholy regime</strong>.</p>

      <h2>✦ I-A. Uranium: Levels of Enrichment</h2>
      <p>The crisis revolves around <strong>uranium-235 (U-235)</strong>. Natural ore contains only 0.7 % U-235; centrifuges spin it to higher purity:</p>

      <table>
        <tr>
          <th>Purity</th>
          <th>Label</th>
          <th>Primary Use</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>≤ 5 %</td>
          <td>Low-Enriched (LEU)</td>
          <td>Civilian power reactors</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>5–20 %</td>
          <td>Medium</td>
          <td>Research &amp; medical reactors</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>20–60 %</td>
          <td>High-Enriched</td>
          <td>Short “break-out” to weapons-grade</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>≥ 90 %</td>
          <td>Weapons-Grade</td>
          <td>Nuclear warheads</td>
        </tr>
      </table>

      <p>According to the <a href="https://www.reuters.com/graphics/IRAN-NUCLEAR/ISRAEL/dwvklgrgjpm/2025-06-18/the-damage-to-iran-nuclear-programme/" target="_blank">IAEA data quoted by Reuters</a>, Iran had already stockpiled more than 400 kg of uranium enriched to <strong>60 %</strong> — perilously close to bomb-grade — before the strikes.</p>

      <h2>✦ II. Was This an Act of Peace?</h2>
      <p>No.</p>
      <p>Bombs are not peace.<br>But neither is <strong>permitting the machinery of genocide</strong> to assemble unchallenged.</p>
      <p>This wasn’t warmongering. It was <strong>a strike against the potential for mass murder</strong>, against a regime that:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Publicly chants “Death to Israel” and “Death to America.”</li>
        <li>Arms proxies with missiles aimed at schools, hospitals, and markets.</li>
        <li>Executes dissenters, women, and Christians alike.</li>
        <li>Blocks IAEA inspections when it suits its aims.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>✦ III. Were Any Treaties Broken?</h2>
      <p>Iran is party to the <strong>Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT)</strong>, yet it suspended IAEA “Additional Protocol” access and enriched to 60 % after 2018 (<a href="https://www.iaea.org/newscenter/statements/iaea-director-general-grossis-statement-to-unsc-on-situation-in-iran-20-june-2025" target="_blank">IAEA statement to UNSC</a>).</p>
      <p>The U.S.-Israel strike lacked UN mandate, yes — but international law often lags existential threats.</p>

      <h2>✦ IV. “Trump Is a Fool,” They Say. “Bombs Don’t Bring Peace.”</h2>
      <p>They’re not wrong to fear war. They’re not wrong to hate destruction.</p>
      <p>But <strong>peace built on denial is not peace — it’s delay</strong>. The question is larger than any one president:</p>
      <blockquote>Do we allow a sworn enemy of life and liberty to gather the power to vaporize cities… because confrontation makes us uncomfortable?</blockquote>

      <h2>✦ V. The Sword and the Plowshare</h2>
      <p>Christ is the Prince of Peace.<br>But He is also the Lamb who returns with a sword.</p>
      <blockquote>“Think not that I am come to send peace on earth: I came not to send peace, but a sword.”<br>— <em>Matthew 10:34, Geneva Bible (1599)</em>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Truth divides. Justice sometimes arrives with fire.</p>

      <h2>✦ VI. To the One Crying Out in Disbelief</h2>
      <p>If you’re angry… good. That means you’re alive. But let anger bow to truth.</p>
      <p>The bombs were a <strong>line drawn to defend future life</strong>, not a conquest of land or oil.</p>

      <h2>✦ VII. Final Word: The Narrow Path Between Cowardice and Fury</h2>
      <p>We at Tiller.Earth are not partisans. We are stewards of land, law, language, and truth.</p>
      <p><strong>Peace without justice is slavery; justice without truth is chaos.</strong></p>

      <blockquote>“He shall judge among the nations… they shall beat their swords into mattocks.”<br>— <em>Isaiah 2:4, Geneva Bible (1599)</em>
      </blockquote>
      <p><em>Until that day, we watch, we warn, and we wield truth like a double-edged blade.</em></p>

        <h2>By Devon Tyler of the Paccillo Family</h2>
        <p><em>Trustee, Faith Frontier Ecclesiastical Trust</em></p>
        <blockquote>
          “<strong>Woe unto them that call evil good, and good evil;</strong> that put darkness for light, and light for darkness; that put bitter for sweet, and sweet for bitter.”<br>
          <span>— Isaiah 5:20, 1599 Geneva Bible</span>
        </blockquote>
        <p>I was raised in the house of law and order. My stepfather wore the badge. He carried the weight of the oath, the radio on his hip, the right to detain, the power to accuse. And in that shadow, I was groomed to do the same — to one day become the next man in uniform.</p>
        <p>But I didn’t follow in his footsteps.</p>
        <p>Not out of hate. Not out of laziness. But out of <strong>holy conviction</strong>.</p>

        <h2>From Obedience to Awakening</h2>
        <p>As a boy, I played by every rule. I showed up, I stood straight, I smiled on cue. My grades were clean, my record spotless. But beneath that surface was a fire: a hunger for truth, a sense of justice I couldn’t unsee.</p>
        <p>When I turned eighteen, the world opened and the veil tore. The same government that spoke of liberty was <strong>caging men for herbs</strong> — for the very same plant I used to calm my spirit and connect with the earth: cannabis.</p>
        <p>My stepfather’s department put shackles on peaceful men. I couldn’t stand behind that. I couldn’t pretend that was justice. I couldn’t turn my back on what I knew was right. So I asked questions — and in asking, I became dangerous to the silence that upheld the system.</p>

        <h2>Burdened by Bloodlines</h2>
        <p>There was always a fear in my family. Not one spoken, but one felt. A fear that I would become like <strong>the men before me</strong> — men whose names still echo in sealed courtrooms and backroom conversations.</p>
        <p>Frank Materio. Tied to Nicky Scarfo. My uncle. My great-grandfather. Names whispered but never explained. Power that lingered in the blood. History I wasn’t supposed to ask about.</p>
        <p>So I was steered away. Guided hard. Not for evil — but out of fear. My family, in their love, tried to protect me from becoming “like them.” But fear doesn’t form freedom. It forms <strong>fences</strong>.</p>

        <h2>The Rebel with a Record</h2>
        <p>When I finally chose my own path, it wasn’t one of chaos — it was one of <strong>righteous rebellion</strong>. I studied the Constitution. The Geneva Bible. I read court cases and scripture side by side. I questioned authority not to tear it down, but to lift it back into alignment with truth.</p>
        <p>But the system doesn't forgive curiosity — not when it threatens control. So they labeled me. <strong>Criminal.</strong> Just like they did to prophets, to revolutionaries, to men who refused to kneel to Babylon.</p>
        <blockquote>“<strong>Have I therefore become your enemy, because I tell you the truth?</strong>” — Galatians 4:16</blockquote>

        <h2>My Oath Is Higher</h2>
        <p>I didn’t reject the law. I rejected the lie. I didn’t flee from duty. I accepted a <strong>higher one</strong>.</p>
        <p>My hands are still trained for work — for tile, for timber, for land. But my soul is aligned with something eternal. I serve not the State, but the Kingdom. I walk not by permission, but by promise. I speak not for approval, but under anointed authority.</p>

        <h2>A New Inheritance</h2>
        <p>I stand now as a <strong>man of covenant</strong>, of equity, of resurrection. My labor is lawful. My identity is divine. My family name is no longer tied to shadows — it’s rooted in sacred soil.</p>
        <p>I didn’t follow in my stepdad’s footsteps, because I was born to break a generational spell. Not to dishonor him — but to redeem what he could not.</p>
        <p>I am the living testimony that the bloodline can be cleansed. That the land can be restored. That the name can be redeemed.</p>
        <blockquote>“<strong>And they shall rebuild the old ruins, and raise up the former desolations... and they shall be called the Repairer of the breach, the Restorer of paths to dwell in.</strong>” — Isaiah 58:12</blockquote>
        <p>I am not lost. I am <strong>returned</strong>. Not to the system — but to the soil. Not to the badge — but to the Book. Not to the curse — but to the covenant.</p>

        <h2>I didn’t follow his footsteps.</h2>
        <p>I forged my own.</p>

      How engineered fracture of tribe empowers the state and weakens inheritance.

  </summary>

  <div class="archive-body">
    <article>
      <h1>The Family Was Broken on Purpose: How Society Undermines Tribal Strength to Control the Masses</h1>
      <p>Society, by design, has systematically eroded the family unit—not as a byproduct of progress, but as a tool of control. Through generations of policy, culture, and economic engineering, the natural order of family, tribe, and stewardship has been fractured, replaced by dependence on centralized systems that extract our energy, steal our inheritance, and silence our sovereignty.</p>

      <h2>Roots of the Breakdown</h2>
      <p>This did not happen by accident. Through industrialization, compulsory schooling, taxation of labor, and land dispossession, our people were pulled from the soil and placed into systems of economic servitude. Families once worked the land together, raised children through the wisdom of elders, and worshiped God in sacred trust. That fabric has been torn apart.</p>
      <p>Urban migration, career dependency, and the glorification of state authority over fatherly or ancestral guidance severed the thread of intergenerational wisdom. Instead of nurturing our own, we are taught to compete, isolate, and conform.</p>

      <h2>The Ego Trap and Parental Abandonment</h2>
      <p>One of the clearest signs of this breakdown is the cultural ego trap that turns parenting into performance. Many parents, conditioned by their own trauma or programmed vision of success, treat their children’s struggles as justification for their own pain rather than an opportunity to break cycles.</p>
      <p>When a child diverges from the path laid before them—whether spiritually, vocationally, or philosophically—some parents withdraw love, financial support, or even relationship itself. At 18, many are cast out not into freedom, but into a system waiting to exploit their confusion. This abandonment is not natural. It is a symptom of generations of severance from true kinship.</p>
      <p>The ego trap turns what should be sacred succession into spiritual sabotage. Instead of building <em>up and up</em>, each generation is made to start over, in debt, divided, and disoriented.</p>

      <h2>Who Benefits From the Fracture?</h2>
      <p>The state. The banks. The bureaucracies. The corporations. All systems that feed on the isolated, the unrooted, and the spiritually disinherited. If your identity comes from a paycheck, a program, or a prison, then you are easier to manipulate than one grounded in family, faith, and land.</p>
      <p>By turning fathers into suspects, mothers into consumers, and children into wards of the state, the system replaces natural law with policy, covenant with contract, and inheritance with paperwork. The result is generations of people who no longer know who they are—or worse, believe they are what the system tells them to be.</p>

      <h2>Sacred Solutions: Rebuilding the Tribe</h2>
      <p>The antidote is not rebellion. It is <strong>remembrance</strong>. We must restore the family not as a nuclear unit within the state, but as a sovereign expression of divine law. This includes:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Covenantal Trusts</strong> to hold family assets outside state control</li>
        <li><strong>Land-based living</strong> that revives ancestral stewardship</li>
        <li><strong>Intergenerational learning</strong> that honors the wisdom of elders</li>
        <li><strong>Sacred courtship and parenting</strong> that sees children as spiritual succession, not property</li>
      </ul>
      <p>True nationhood is not granted by papers or flags. It is lived. It is protected. It is handed down.</p>

      <h2>The Faith Frontier</h2>
      <p>At Faith Frontier and Tiller Earth, we believe the rebuilding begins at home—on the land, in the trust, through sacred work. We are not merely reacting to brokenness; we are <em>redeeming inheritance</em>. Every family that heals, every trust that forms, every piece of land that is restored becomes a brick in the altar of a free people.</p>
      <p>This is not about going back in time—it’s about recovering what was always ours: the sacred balance of Father, Family, Fellowship, and Fruitfulness.</p>

      <h2>Join Us</h2>
      <p>If you feel the call to restore what was stolen—to reject the orphan system and rebuild your family into a living, lawful, land-rooted legacy—then Tiller.Earth is your soil. Let us walk together.</p>

        <p><em>Exposing the financial and political structure behind municipal policing, and how to reclaim true justice.</em></p>
      </header>

      <section>
        <h2>The Political and Corporate Nature of Policing</h2>
        <p>Policing in America is not just law enforcement—it is a business. Police departments are subsidiaries of municipal corporations, operating under <strong>D-U-N-S numbers</strong> like private companies. This allows them to function as <em>financial entities</em> rather than public service institutions.</p>
        <p>Their authority does not derive from the Constitution but from <strong>corporate municipal codes</strong>, which are often enforced as if they were law.</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p><strong>“All laws which are repugnant to the Constitution are null and void.”</strong></p>
          <footer>- Marbury v. Madison, 5 U.S. 137 (1803)</footer>
        </blockquote>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Municipal Corporations: The Business of Law Enforcement</h2>
        <p>All cities and townships in the United States are structured as <strong>municipal corporations</strong>. These corporations:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Hold assets and debt.</li>
          <li>Enter into contracts, including <strong>insurance bond agreements</strong>.</li>
          <li>Generate revenue through fines, asset forfeiture, and taxation.</li>
          <li>Operate courts as administrative tribunals rather than true constitutional courts.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Police do not uphold constitutional law—they enforce municipal policies that generate revenue.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>The Insurance Bonds That Protect the System</h2>
        <p>Municipal police departments carry <strong>liability insurance bonds</strong> that shield them from the financial consequences of misconduct. When officers commit unconstitutional acts:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Settlements are paid through municipal insurance, <strong>not from officer salaries.</strong></li>
          <li>This creates <strong>plausible deniability</strong>, allowing officers to act without personal accountability.</li>
          <li>In some cases, <strong>police brutality bonds</strong> are sold to investors, <strong>profiting from injustice.</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p>This financial protection encourages reckless policing, as there is no personal cost for officers who violate rights.</p>
        <p>To request insurance bond information for your local police department, file a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Constitutional Violations and Legal Loopholes</h2>
        <p>Municipal ordinances are <strong>not laws</strong>; they are corporate policies. Many interactions with police involve:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Unlawful ID checks with no reasonable suspicion.</li>
          <li>Detainment under city ordinances rather than state or federal law.</li>
          <li>Fines and arrests issued for profit, <strong>not public safety.</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Legal doctrines like <strong>qualified immunity</strong> further insulate officers, making it almost impossible to hold them accountable in court.</p>

        <h2>Scripture: A Higher Law That Condemns Corrupt Governance</h2>
        <blockquote>
          <p><strong>“How long will ye judge unjustly, and accept the persons of the wicked? Selah. Defend the poor and fatherless: do justice to the afflicted and needy.”</strong></p>
          <footer>- Psalm 82, Geneva Bible</footer>
        </blockquote>
        <p>The municipal corporate structure violates the very principles of justice and righteousness. The power they wield is financial, not moral.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>The Solution: How Policing Should Operate Under Constitutional Law</h2>
        <p>To dismantle the financial and corporate entanglement of policing, the following must happen:</p>

        <h3>1. Enforce Constitutional Standards</h3>
        <p>Police must be trained in <strong>constitutional law</strong>, not just municipal policy.</p>

        <h3>2. Eliminate Qualified Immunity</h3>
        <p>Officers should face <strong>personal liability</strong> for unconstitutional actions.</p>

        <h3>3. End Revenue-Based Law Enforcement</h3>
        <p>Policing should not be a financial enterprise. The practice of using fines and forfeitures as revenue must end.</p>

        <h3>4. Demand Transparency in Municipal Bonds</h3>
        <p>Every <strong>insurance claim, settlement, and bond issuance</strong> should be made public.</p>

        <h3>5. Stop Illegal Detainment Under Corporate Ordinances</h3>
        <p>Civil rights lawsuits should challenge the unlawful enforcement of ordinances as criminal acts.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Final Revelation: The System Isn’t Broken—It’s Working as Designed</h2>
        <p>The policing system is functioning exactly as intended—to <strong>extract wealth from the public</strong> while <strong>protecting municipal corporations from liability.</strong></p>
        <p>It is time to demand accountability, transparency, and constitutional governance.</p>

      How a gold-backed standard could reset business ethics, stability, and shared prosperity.
    </span>
  </summary>

  <div class="archive-body">
    <article>
      <h2>A Resurgence of Ethical Entrepreneurship and Societal Flourishing</h2>
      <p>In the current global economic landscape, characterized by persistent inflation, volatile markets, and an erosion of trust in financial institutions, the concept of a return to the gold standard has re-emerged as a potential solution. This essay delves into the profound transformative impact such a shift could have, not simply on monetary policy, but also on the very fabric of business and society. It explores how the gold standard could potentially usher in a new era of ethical entrepreneurship and societal flourishing, fostering a sense of stability, accountability, and shared prosperity.</p>
      <p>The gold standard, with its intrinsic link between currency value and a tangible, finite asset like gold, inherently introduces a level of stability and accountability that fiat currency systems, often susceptible to inflation and manipulation, have struggled to maintain. This stability creates a fertile ground for a new wave of entrepreneurship, one that is rooted in ethical principles, long-term value creation, and a deep-seated commitment to societal improvement.</p>

      <h2>The Gold Standard: A Foundation for Responsible Business Practices</h2>
      <p>The return to a gold standard could act as a catalyst for a paradigm shift in the business world, moving away from the prevailing focus on short-term profit maximization towards a more sustainable and ethical approach. This shift would be driven by the inherent stability and accountability that the gold standard provides.</p>

      <h3>Stability and Predictability: A Catalyst for Long-Term Vision</h3>
      <p>With currency fluctuations minimized, businesses would have the freedom to focus on long-term strategies. They could invest in research and development, build strong community relationships, and prioritize sustainable practices without the constant fear of inflation eroding their investments. This newfound stability would allow businesses to invest in projects that yield long-term benefits, fostering a sense of responsibility towards future generations and ensuring that economic growth is sustainable and inclusive.</p>

      <h3>Accountability and Transparency: Rebuilding Trust and Fostering Ethical Practices</h3>
      <p>The gold standard inherently promotes transparency and accountability within organizations. As currency fluctuations become less volatile, the need for complex and opaque financial instruments decreases. Businesses would be incentivized to adopt clear and transparent financial practices, making it easier for stakeholders to understand their operations and hold them responsible for their actions. This fosters a more ethical business environment, where transparency is valued and accountability is paramount.</p>

      <h3>Reduced Speculation and Manipulation: A Shift from Short-Term Gains to Sustainable Value Creation</h3>
      <p>The gold standard's inherent stability discourages speculative trading and manipulation of currency markets. Businesses would be less likely to engage in risky and unethical practices to protect their profits against inflation. This encourages a shift towards long-term value creation, prioritizing quality products, sustainable practices, and responsible investment strategies. By focusing on sustainable growth, businesses can create lasting value for their stakeholders and contribute to a healthier and more equitable society.</p>

      <h2>A New Wave of Entrepreneurship: Driven by Purpose and Impact</h2>
      <p>Beyond its impact on existing businesses, the gold standard has the potential to inspire a new generation of entrepreneurs driven by purpose and impact. The stability and predictability of a gold-backed currency system would encourage individuals to take the leap into entrepreneurship, knowing that their efforts will be rewarded with a fair and stable return. This could lead to a more diverse and inclusive entrepreneurial landscape, with startups, nonprofits, LLCs, and social enterprises all flourishing.</p>

      <h3>The Rise of Social Enterprises: Combining Profitability with Social Impact</h3>
      <p>The gold standard's emphasis on long-term value creation and community well-being would foster the growth of social enterprises. These organizations, dedicated to addressing social and environmental challenges while generating profits, would find a fertile ground for growth under a stable monetary system. With less concern about inflation eroding their investments, social enterprises could confidently invest in initiatives that promote sustainable development, alleviate poverty, and improve access to education and healthcare.</p>

      <h3>A New Era of Innovation and Creativity: Fueled by Purpose and a Shared Vision</h3>
      <p>The gold standard could lead to a surge in innovation and creativity, as entrepreneurs driven by purpose rather than profit alone are free to pursue bold and impactful ideas. This shift in mindset could lead to the development of new technologies, products, and services that address pressing societal challenges, fostering economic growth while contributing to a more sustainable and just world.</p>

      <h2>The Ripple Effect: Building a More Equitable and Sustainable Society</h2>
      <p>The gold standard's positive impact would extend beyond the business world, rippling out to create a more equitable and sustainable society. By fostering a more stable and ethical economic environment, it could lead to a more equitable distribution of wealth, improved access to essential services, and a stronger sense of community.</p>

      <h3>Strengthening Communities: Investing in Local Initiatives and Empowering Local Businesses</h3>
      <p>The gold standard would encourage businesses to invest in their local communities with greater confidence. With a stable monetary system, businesses could support local initiatives, provide job opportunities, and contribute to community development projects without the fear of economic shocks or currency devaluation undermining their efforts. This fosters a stronger sense of social responsibility and strengthens the bond between businesses and the communities they serve.</p>

      <h3>Investing in Education, Healthcare, and Housing: Building a More Equitable Future</h3>
      <p>A stable economic environment created by the gold standard would enable governments and private organizations to invest more effectively in essential services like education, healthcare, and housing. This investment would not only improve the quality of life for individuals but also contribute to a more productive and skilled workforce, leading to long-term economic growth and prosperity.</p>

      <h3>Enhancing Financial Literacy and Empowering Individuals: Building a More Inclusive Economy</h3>
      <p>The gold standard's focus on transparency and accountability could lead to an increase in financial literacy among individuals. With simpler and more transparent financial systems, people would be better equipped to manage their finances, make informed investment decisions, and participate more actively in the economy. This increased financial literacy would empower individuals, promoting economic inclusion and reducing vulnerability to financial exploitation.</p>

      <h2>The Moral Compass of Business: Redefining Success Beyond Profit</h2>
      <p>The gold standard's impact transcends economics. It represents a fundamental shift in the moral compass of business. By eliminating the instability and uncertainty associated with fiat currency systems, the gold standard creates a more ethical and equitable playing field. Businesses are no longer incentivized to engage in risky and unethical practices to protect their profits against inflation. Instead, they can focus on building sustainable, ethical businesses that benefit both their stakeholders and the wider community.</p>
      <p>The gold standard could serve as a powerful catalyst for positive change. It can inspire a new generation of entrepreneurs to prioritize purpose over profit, community over competition, and sustainability over short-term gains. This shift in mindset can have a profound impact on the world, leading to a more ethical, sustainable, and equitable future for all.</p>

      <h2>Beyond Economic Stability: A Foundation for Societal Progress</h2>
      <p>The gold standard is not just about economic stability. It is about creating a more just, equitable, and sustainable society. By fostering a stable and ethical economic environment, it creates the conditions for businesses to thrive, communities to flourish, and individuals to reach their full potential. It is a bold idea with the potential to fundamentally reshape the very fabric of business and society.</p>
      <p>As we navigate a world grappling with economic instability and social injustice, the concept of returning to the gold standard deserves serious consideration. By creating a stable and ethical foundation for our economic system, we can pave the way for a future where businesses are not just profit-driven entities, but engines of societal progress and prosperity.</p>

      Following Dan Smoot, the Federal Reserve, and the fight to restore a constitutional Republic.
    </span>
  </summary>

  <div class="archive-body">
    <div class="content-wrapper">
      <h1>Saving the True Nature of Our Republic</h1>
      <p>In recent decades, the fundamental nature of the American Republic has been distorted. What was once a system of checks and balances, designed to protect the liberties of the people and limit government overreach, has increasingly come to resemble a corporate business model, driven by profit and influenced by powerful special interests. This shift has eroded the core principles upon which our Republic was founded. As Dan Smoot, the American conservative political commentator, so powerfully articulated, preserving the true nature of our Republic is not just a moral obligation but a civic duty.</p>

      <h2>The True Nature of Our Republic</h2>
      <p>The United States was founded as a Constitutional Republic, a system in which the government’s power is derived from the people and is limited by law. The primary purpose of this system was to ensure individual liberty and prevent any single group, whether governmental or corporate, from accumulating unchecked power. The founding principles of the Republic were designed to create a system where:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Sovereignty belongs to the people:</strong> The government exists to serve the people, not to control or exploit them.</li>
        <li><strong>Checks and balances:</strong> Power is divided among three branches of government (legislative, executive, and judicial) to ensure that no single entity could dominate or oppress the populace.</li>
        <li><strong>Rule of law:</strong> Laws are applied equally to all individuals, protecting the rights of the minority against the will of the majority.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Dan Smoot emphasized that the American Republic was meant to be small, limited, and protective of individual freedoms. Smoot, like many other defenders of the Republic, warned that as the government expands and merges with corporate interests, the true essence of our Republic is under threat.</p>

      <h2>The Infiltration of Corporate Power</h2>
      <p>The rise of corporate power, particularly through the Federal Reserve System, has deeply affected the way our government operates. Instead of being answerable to the people, government institutions have become increasingly influenced by corporate interests, creating a system where profits and special interests dictate policy more than the will of the people.</p>
      <blockquote>"The American Republic is meant to be small, limited, and protective of individual freedoms. We must defend it against corporate and financial tyranny." - Dan Smoot</blockquote>
      <p>The Federal Reserve, which controls the nation’s money supply, operates independently of the government and has turned the U.S. economy into a debt-based system. This allows a small group of financial elites to control the levers of power, printing money at will, charging interest to the government, and pushing the nation into an ever-growing cycle of debt. The result is a government that is more beholden to corporate and financial interests than to its citizens.</p>

      <h2>Consequences of Losing the Republic's True Nature</h2>
      <p>When government operates more like a business than a system of checks and balances, it creates dangerous outcomes:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Consolidation of Power:</strong> Corporate interests gain power and influence, diminishing the voice and rights of individuals. Decisions are made based on profit and control, not on the protection of liberty or justice.</li>
        <li><strong>Erosion of Sovereignty:</strong> As government and corporate entities merge, the sovereignty of the people is compromised. Citizens are treated more as subjects to be controlled than as sovereign individuals with natural rights.</li>
        <li><strong>Loss of Accountability:</strong> In a business-driven government, policies are often made behind closed doors, influenced by special interests and lobbyists. The result is a government that lacks transparency and is not accountable to the people it was designed to serve.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Dan Smoot’s Vision: Restoring the Republic</h2>
      <p>Dan Smoot’s work focused on restoring the Constitutional Republic to its true form by emphasizing limited government, individual sovereignty, and the importance of adhering to the Constitution. Smoot believed that the power of the people was being usurped by unelected bureaucrats and financial elites who use the government as a tool to consolidate wealth and control.</p>
      <p>To save the Republic, Smoot advocated for a return to these key principles:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Restoration of Constitutional Limits:</strong> The federal government must be returned to its constitutional boundaries, limited in scope, and prevented from expanding into areas that infringe on individual rights and state sovereignty.</li>
        <li><strong>Abolishment of the Federal Reserve:</strong> Smoot called for the elimination of the Federal Reserve and the return to a sound monetary system—one in which money is backed by real value, such as gold, and where the government cannot print money at will, devaluing the currency and indebting future generations.</li>
        <li><strong>Reclaiming Sovereignty:</strong> The American people must reclaim their sovereignty, demanding that elected officials serve their constituents, not corporate interests or unelected bureaucrats.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Reclaiming the Republic: What Can Be Done?</h2>
      <p>Saving the true nature of our Republic begins with recognizing how far we’ve strayed from its founding principles and taking concrete actions to restore it. Here’s how we can begin:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Push for Government Accountability:</strong> Hold elected officials accountable for their actions. Ensure that the government operates within its constitutional limits and that any policies or decisions are made transparently, with input from the people.</li>
        <li><strong>Demand the End of Corporate Control:</strong> Advocate for policies that limit the influence of corporate lobbying and reduce the power of financial institutions like the Federal Reserve. Government should serve the people, not corporate elites.</li>
        <li><strong>Educate and Organize:</strong> Follow the example of Dan Smoot by educating yourself and others about the true nature of the Republic. Organize within your communities to spread awareness of the Constitution and the principles of limited government, individual liberty, and checks and balances.</li>
        <li><strong>Return to Sound Money:</strong> Advocate for a return to sound monetary policy that limits inflation, reduces national debt, and removes the ability of private banks to control the economy.</li>
        <li><strong>Reassert Individual Sovereignty:</strong> Recognize your rights as a sovereign individual and push back against any form of government overreach that seeks to limit your freedom. The Republic was built on the idea that the people are the ultimate authority, and we must protect that legacy.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Conclusion: The Fight for the Republic</h2>
      <p>As Dan Smoot wisely noted, the preservation of the American Republic rests on the willingness of the people to stand up for its founding principles. Government is not meant to be a business; it is meant to be a system of checks and balances that protects our liberty, promotes justice, and ensures accountability.</p>
      <p>The influx of corporate power into government institutions, coupled with the influence of the Federal Reserve, threatens to dismantle the Republic as we know it. It’s time to reclaim the true nature of our Republic by restoring the Constitution, rejecting corporate influence, and protecting the sovereignty of the people.</p>
      <p>Let’s remember the words of Dan Smoot and commit ourselves to restoring a government that serves its people, not profits.</p>
