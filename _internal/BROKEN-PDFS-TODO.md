# PDF Content To-Do

This checklist is maintained in the internal workspace. See:

- `_internal/BROKEN-PDFS-TODO.md`

## Action Required

Replace all placeholder PDFs with the correct, final documents as soon as possible.

## Upload Instructions

1. Obtain the authentic PDF files for each listed case or filing.
2. Replace the placeholder files in their respective `cases/`&lt;slug&gt;`/filings/` directories.
3. Commit and push your changes to the repository.
4. Verify that all PDF links work correctly on the published site.

**Important:** Broken or placeholder PDFs result in nonfunctional links and may impact user trust and compliance. Ensure all uploads meet repository standards as defined in `/.ai/OUTPUT_RULES.md` and validate file integrity before publishing.
