## Reflection & Public Context

This action highlights the complex relationship between local policing,
constitutional boundaries, and the treatment of self-represented litigants
within the federal judiciary.  
It underscores the importance of *pro se* access to justice and the
responsibility of municipal actors to respect the limits of lawful authority.  
As the case proceeds, it will test the procedural balance between screening
standards under *§ 1915(e)* and the substantive right to redress guaranteed by
the Constitution.
