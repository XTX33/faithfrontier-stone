summary: >
  Civil-rights action brought under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 by Devon Tyler Barber,
  alleging constitutional violations arising from arrest, detention, and
  medical treatment at the Atlantic County Justice Facility and by related
  municipal actors and contractors. The case was administratively terminated
  in November 2023 under Local Rule 10.1(a) after returned mail, then
  dismissed by Memorandum Opinion and Order in December 2023.  
  In September 2025, Barber submitted an Amended Complaint and Motion to
  Reopen with updated contact information, which remain pending before the
  District Court.

faith_note: >
  This case examines how procedural technicalities—such as address
  requirements—can impede substantive review of constitutional claims by
  self-represented litigants.  It challenges the federal judiciary to balance
  docket efficiency with access to justice and good-faith pro se participation.
