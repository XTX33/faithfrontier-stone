The street-crossing matter is being pursued through post-conviction relief in the Law Division and, in parallel, through an appeal in the Appellate Division. This consolidated record keeps both dockets together so filings, orders, and context remain aligned with the broader Faith Frontier narrative.

Key filings and orders are organized in the docket below. Supporting materials remain available in the original PCR portal directory while appellate documents are linked directly.
