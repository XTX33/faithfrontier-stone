## Background
This appeal continues from **ATL-24-001934**, a Law Division matter
arising out of a February 2024 street-crossing stop by Officer Boyd.
The appellant contends the encounter and subsequent prosecution violated
constitutional protections against unreasonable seizure and unequal
treatment, and that appointed counsel failed to preserve those issues.

## Legal Issues
- Whether the detention constituted an unlawful stop under the
  **Fourth Amendment** and **N.J. Const. art. I, ¶ 7**.  
- Whether selective enforcement and discriminatory treatment infringed
  **equal-protection rights** under the **Fourteenth Amendment**.  
- Whether counsel’s omissions meet the *Strickland/Fritz* standard for
  ineffective assistance.  
- Whether the Law Division’s failure to consolidate and rule on the
  PCR petitions denied fundamental fairness and due process.

## Reflection / Context
This appeal tests how New Jersey’s courts handle minor-offense detentions
that raise constitutional questions. It forms part of Faith Frontier’s
public record of self-represented post-conviction litigation and the
intersection between law enforcement conduct, equal protection, and
access to justice in the state system.
