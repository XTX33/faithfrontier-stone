     Narrative / Case Overview
     ======================= -->

## Background
Explain the core facts in 2–4 paragraphs: who the parties are, what events led to the filing, and any procedural posture that matters (e.g., appeal, reinstatement, dismissal).

## Legal Issues
List the primary questions raised (constitutional, statutory, or procedural).  
Use short bullets or numbered items:
- Whether the agency acted within lawful authority.
- Whether notice and opportunity to be heard were sufficient.
- Whether equitable relief or damages are appropriate.

## Timeline of Key Events
| Date | Event |
|------|--------|
| YYYY-MM-DD | Filing of complaint / petition |
| YYYY-MM-DD | Response / motion |
| YYYY-MM-DD | Court order / next hearing |
| YYYY-MM-DD | Status update |

## Public Filings
All redacted public filings are listed below automatically from the folder:

Add PDFs to that folder and rebuild — no edits required here.
