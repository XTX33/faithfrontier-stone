## I. Case Background

The case stems from a **February 2024 street-crossing stop** in Atlantic County involving Officer Boyd.  
The officer alleged jaywalking, though Mr. Barber maintains he crossed lawfully—walking at right angles within the roadway after briefly stopping in the center of a marked crosswalk.  
He asserts that Officer Boyd, observing from the Walmart parking area, mistakenly believed he had crossed from the nearby Woodworks apartment complex.

When approached, Mr. Barber identified himself by name and website but declined to provide a date of birth or Social Security number, invoking his right to privacy.  
Officer Boyd stated, *“I’m not going to give you a ticket,”* indicating the stop’s purpose appeared to be a warrant inquiry rather than pedestrian enforcement.  
No interference with traffic or safety occurred.

Despite this, the encounter was escalated into a charge of **obstructing the administration of law**—a claim Mr. Barber characterizes as frivolous and retaliatory.  
He questions what “investigation” he could have obstructed, whether any lawful investigation or warrant existed, and on what reasonable, articulable suspicion such surveillance or detention was based.  
The subsequent filings and grand-jury referral, he argues, reflect a **pattern of prosecutorial overreach and misconduct**, criminalizing his assertion of constitutional rights after prior incidents of governmental abuse.

The resulting case was merged into **Law Division docket ATL-24-001934**.  
Mr. Barber contends the stop, charge, and ensuing prosecution violated the **Fourth Amendment**, **Fourteenth Amendment**, and **Article I, ¶¶ 1 and 7 of the New Jersey Constitution**.  
He sought post-conviction relief under *R.* 3:22 and appealed the Law Division’s failure to adjudicate or consolidate the record, maintaining that the proceedings exemplify systemic disregard for due process and equal protection.

## IV. Legal Issues
- Whether the detention and identification demand constituted an unlawful stop
  under **Fourth Amendment** and **N.J. Const. art. I, ¶ 7**.  
- Whether **selective enforcement** or retaliation violated **equal-protection**
  and **due-process** rights.  
- Whether appointed counsel’s omissions satisfy the *Strickland/Fritz*
  ineffective-assistance threshold.  
- Whether the Law Division’s inaction and fragmented record deprived petitioner
  of meaningful post-conviction review.

## V. Related Cases and Context
This appeal is part of a larger continuum of public-record PCR and appellate
matters documenting systemic fairness and access to justice:

- [State v. Barber — Unified PCR (ATL-22-002292 / 2313)](/cases/barber-nj-pcr-2022/)  
- [Faith Frontier Case Index](/cases/)  

Together, these cases illustrate how constitutional claims progress through
New Jersey’s hybrid post-conviction and appellate systems.
