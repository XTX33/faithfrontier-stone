summary: >
  The New Jersey Turnpike Authority (NJTA) filed a Special Civil Part action
  seeking $5,109.45 in alleged unpaid tolls and administrative fees.
  After an initial clerk’s default, the court reinstated the matter on
  October 27 2025, ordering both parties to comply with discovery.
  Devon Tyler Barber, appearing pro se, filed an Amended Answer and
  Counterclaim alleging that NJTA’s fee structure exceeds statutory limits
  and violates due-process and proportionality principles. Discovery now
  proceeds under a Track 1 schedule.

faith_note: >
  This case tests whether public agencies may treat toll enforcement as a
  revenue system or must remain faithful stewards of a public trust.
  It asks how far a government authority can go in balancing efficiency
  against fairness, transparency, and constitutional restraint.
