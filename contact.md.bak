  <h2>If You Are in Legal Trouble Right Now</h2>
  <p>
    If you are facing an active criminal charge, eviction, domestic violence, or other urgent legal crisis,
    consider contacting a licensed attorney or local legal-aid organization immediately. Time limits in law
    are real, and missing a deadline can be difficult or impossible to fix.

  <h2>Prayer &amp; Encouragement</h2>
  <p>
    If you simply need someone to stand in prayer with you for wisdom, courage, and clarity in the middle of
    legal or personal trials, you are welcome to say so in your message. While no promises can be made about
    detailed replies, your situation can be lifted before the Lord.
