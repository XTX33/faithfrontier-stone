# Faith Frontier Narrative Refactor & Case Archive Upgrade Summary

**Date:** December 2025  
**Version:** 2.0  
**Branch:** copilot/full-narrative-refactor

## Overview

This document summarizes the comprehensive site-wide transformation that integrates Faith Frontier's autobiographical narrative and upgrades the case archive system to professional legal documentation standards.

## Narrative Integration

### Core Story Elements Integrated

The Faith Frontier narrative now flows throughout the site, telling the complete story:

1. **Childhood Duality**: Growing up between two houses, two fathers, two ways of seeing the world
2. **Searching Questions**: Rituals without meaning, traditions without depth, sincere questions about purpose
3. **Pandemic Exile**: Institutional pressure, conformity demands, and the journey to the outside
