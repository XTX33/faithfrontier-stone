## Record purpose

This administrative record preserves Open Public Records Act (OPRA) requests and responses concerning vendor contracting, procurement, oversight, and systems relevant to the Atlantic County Justice Facility (ACJF).

This page is a documentation index. It does not assert findings, legal conclusions, or accusations. Where interpretation is needed, it is kept in a separate notes file.

## Scope of requests

- Third-party vendors, contractors, and service providers used at ACJF
- Contracts, amendments, renewals, scopes of work, monitoring provisions, and termination clauses
- Procurement records (RFPs/IFBs, evaluations, awards, purchasing method)
- Performance materials (audits, inspections, deficiency notices, corrective actions)
- Governance and oversight records (role of Sheriff’s Office and County administration)
- Systems and modernization records supporting accountability and due-process-related functions

## Status

- OPRA requests prepared for parallel submission to:
  - Atlantic County Sheriff’s Office
  - Atlantic County (General)
