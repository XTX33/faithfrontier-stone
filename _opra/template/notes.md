# Notes (non-findings)

This file is reserved for **observational notes** and workflow reminders.

- Do not state legal conclusions.
- Do not allege misconduct as fact.
- Keep notes descriptive: dates, who said what, what was received, what is missing.

## Separation rule

This notes page is not a pleading, not argument, and not a substitute for filed materials.  
It exists to keep administrative handling organized while preserving a clean public index.

## Working notes

- [Add neutral notes here]
- [Example: “12/19/2025: custodian acknowledged receipt; asked to clarify scope re: time range.”]
