  <h1>Case Records</h1>
  <p class="lead">
    Documentation of lived experience navigating institutions — a public archive of the
    intersection between law, conscience, and personal truth. Born from a journey of childhood 
    duality and spiritual awakening, these records bear witness to the procedural gaps that 
    ordinary New Jersey residents face, turning hard lessons into pathways toward clarity, 
    due process, and restored trust.
