**Status:** Active — Motion to Dismiss Pending

### Operative Pleading

On **November 25, 2025**, Plaintiff filed a **Second Amended Complaint (SAC)**.  
The SAC was **accepted and docketed** by the Court without rejection or deficiency notice and is the **current operative pleading**, unless and until the Court orders otherwise.

The SAC clarifies factual allegations, narrows conviction-dependent theories, and separates independent claims from any claims that may intersect with post-conviction proceedings.

---

### Pending Motion to Dismiss

Defendants filed a **Rule 4:6-2(e) Motion to Dismiss in Lieu of an Answer** on **November 24, 2025**.

The motion was filed **prior to** the SAC and was not re-noticed or re-briefed as to the amended pleading. As filed, the motion is procedurally directed to a **prior complaint**, raising issues of mootness or limitation as to scope.

The motion is scheduled for decision **on the papers** on **January 9, 2026**.

---

### Amendment Procedure (Rule 4:9-1)

No responsive pleading has been filed by Defendants.

The SAC was submitted to clarify and respond to arguments raised in Defendants’ motion and to ensure proper pleading under New Jersey law. If leave is deemed required, amendment may be granted **nunc pro tunc** in the interest of justice, as no prejudice to Defendants is apparent.

---

### Exoneration Rule — Governing Framework

The SAC expressly applies the New Jersey exoneration doctrine as articulated in:

- *McKnight v. Office of the Public Defender*, 197 N.J. 180 (2008)  
- *Rogers v. Cape May County Office of the Public Defender*, 208 N.J. 414 (2011)

Consistent with those authorities:

- Any **conviction-dependent malpractice theory** is pleaded **in the alternative only** and may be stayed if appropriate.
- **Independent claims** sounding in contract, fiduciary duty, fraud, consumer fraud, negligence unrelated to innocence, and unjust enrichment are pleaded as **actionable regardless of PCR status**.

The exoneration rule is treated as a **gatekeeping doctrine**, not a blanket immunity or global bar to civil claims.

---

### Independent Claims Pleaded

The SAC asserts the following independent causes of action:

- Breach of Contract (retainer nonperformance)
- Breach of Fiduciary Duty (abandonment, non-communication, loyalty and diligence failures)
- Fraud / Fraudulent Inducement (pre-engagement representations)
- Consumer Fraud Act, N.J.S.A. 56:8-1 et seq. (commercial conduct at point of sale)
- Negligence / Gross Negligence (pre-conviction failures independent of innocence)
- Unjust Enrichment (retention of unearned fee)

These claims arise from Defendants’ **pretrial conduct and commercial representations**, not from any adjudication of guilt or innocence.

---

### Damages Framing

Plaintiff alleges damages including:

- Pretrial loss of liberty
- Economic loss and business disruption
- Reputational harm
- Emotional and psychological injury
- Loss of an unearned $5,000 retainer

The SAC does **not** seek to overturn any conviction and does **not** request relief that would require a finding of innocence.

---

### Anticipated Procedural Outcomes

Based on New Jersey practice, the Court may:

- Deny the motion to dismiss as **moot** or limit it to the prior pleading;
- Deny dismissal of the independent claims;
- At most, **stay** any conviction-dependent malpractice theory pending post-conviction review.

Dismissal with prejudice of the SAC would exceed the scope of the motion as filed.
